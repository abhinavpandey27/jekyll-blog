# Renesa - Spring Edition 2021

---
Renesa is the Official Media & Publication House of NIT, Surat. We undertook a magazine project that took ~4 months. A team of ~40 in-house writers and designers worked on it. As a senior designer working on this project, I laid out the visual language of the whole magazine. I led the process of division of work among designers. I also kept checking up on the junior designers to get the work done by the deadline. [Magazine Link.](https://issuu.com/renesa2k19/docs/spring_edition_2021)

# Renesa - Farewell Edition 2020

Farewell edition is the magazine we create for the outgoing batch of our college. Due to the pandemic, the timeline of the magazine shifted many times. Finally, we had to design the magazine in ~3 weeks. These 3 weeks were one of the most intensive weeks for me. I was responsible for laying out the articles in the magazine, making illustrations, and doing the final exports by combining all the pages.
