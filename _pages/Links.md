# Society & Philosophy

**[Shantaram](https://amzn.to/3uppvNn)**:From a quality of writing perspective, this is among the best books I’ve ever read. It’s a 900-page beast, and when my friend told me about it, I said: “Nope, too long. There’s no way I’m reading that.” Then he [read me the first page](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1253142086347415552?s=20), and I was immediately hooked. Maybe it’s because the first sentence encapsulates the book so well: “It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured.”

**José** **Ricón:** I met José at an Emergent Ventures meetup. It took me ~30 seconds to realize he had one of the sharpest minds I’ve ever come across. He can process information faster than just about anybody I’ve ever met. His posts are long, but if you find one that interests you, I can almost guarantee that it’s one of the best introductions to the subject online. If you’re interested in education, I recommend this primer on [_Bloom’s Two-Sigma Problem_](https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma)_._ And if you’re interested in cities, I recommend his post on [rising construction costs](https://nintil.com/building-skyscrapers-and-spending-on-major-projects).

****[**Ten Ways to Destroy the Imagination of Your Child**](https://amzn.to/3hWELgq)**:** I found this book through an [excellent Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/wrathofgnon/status/1126114639517896704). I looked up the author, saw that he was famous for translating Dante, and immediately purchased the book. It’s about the way modernity suppresses childhood imagination. My favorites are “cut all heroes down to size” and “replace the fairy tale with political cliches and fads.” Awe and wonder are under-rated virtues.

****[**Oops, Simon Sarris Did it Again**](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)**:** This man doesn’t miss. Sarris is an engineer living in New Hampshire. He published a wonderful essay called [_The Most Precious Resource is Agency_](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)_._ It’s about our inability to deal with ambitious children, and in turn, beat the drive out of them. In all his writing, I admire the way he balances the spiritual and the material. And though he has a special reverence for beauty, he always remembers to appreciate the mundane. For something longer, I strongly recommend his essay: [_In Praise of Gods_](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-the-gods)_,_ which explores the limits of rationality_._

[**The Condition of the Working Class in England**](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm)**:** I’m perpetually interested in how the Industrial Revolution changed society and consciousness. This account from Friedrich Engels was written in 1845 and had a major influence on Karl Marx. It describes the horrid working conditions in industrial cities like Manchester and Liverpool, where people were divorced from nature, suffered through horrid working conditions, and disproportionately died from diseases like measles and smallpox. Though the whole book is available for free, the [introduction](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/ch02.htm) and [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Condition_of_the_Working_Class_in_England) provide good introductions. If you want more, [you’ll enjoy this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDY5vuMW90s).

****[**McLuhan Unbound**](https://amzn.to/3z9eaEJ)**:** This is a hidden gem, but I’m not sure how to describe it. I could call it a book, but it’s too short for that. I could call it a collection of pamphlets, but the ideas are too sophisticated for that too. We’ll go with an [anthology of essays](https://amzn.to/34ZIILo). They were written in the most creative period of Marshall McLuhan’s life after he published [_The Gutenberg Galaxy_](https://amzn.to/3vdQKe7) but before he published his seminal book: [_Understanding Media_](https://amzn.to/3iAp0h7)_._ I like it both because it’s colorful (which means I can keep it in my living room) and because it’s designed to be read for 10 minutes at a time. Since it’s so easy to read, it doubles as spaced repetition for one of my favorite writers. If you’re looking for an intro to McLuhan, I also recommend [_The Medium is the Massage_](https://amzn.to/3pwKahL) and this [talk with Terrance McKenna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aljs5vlW2u4).

****[**Losing Your Freedom**](https://twitter.com/mutatrum/status/1401199233307394050)**:** This one is heavy. When my friend texted it to me, he said: “I need a cigarette with this.” It’s written by Ross Ulbricht, who founded the [Silk Road marketplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)). He wrote this [speech](https://twitter.com/mutatrum/status/1401199233307394050?s=20) from prison because he’s been given a lifetime sentence without parole. It’s worth reading, no matter what you think about him. He talks about the way we dehumanize prisoners and the torture of losing your freedom. [If you prefer audio, listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=232s).

****[**The Tyranny of Time**](https://www.noemamag.com/the-tyranny-of-time)**:** There are two kinds of time: [body time and mechanical time](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1299778651118952449?s=20). Body time moves by the rhythm of your heart. You eat when you’re hungry and sleep when you’re tired. It moves fast when we’re in the flow and slowly when we’re bored. Mechanical time is the opposite. It always moves at the same speed and does not respond to the needs of individuals. When I’m relaxing, I try to be on body time as much as possible. That’s why I don’t wear a watch and why there are no clocks in my apartment. Though people used to protest against time, we’ve accepted it as an inevitable part of the modern world. [This essay shows how that happened](https://www.noemamag.com/the-tyranny-of-time).

****[**Michael Sugrue’s YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/channel/UCFaYLR_1aryjfB7hLrKGRaQ)**:** This guy is an outstanding speaker and delivers all kinds of philosophy lectures about topics ranging from [_Nietzche and the Death of God_](https://youtu.be/Smq5uRhM_IA)_,_ to [_The Frankfurt School_](https://youtu.be/xX9EI8wEyuY)_,_ to [_Romantic Literature_](https://youtu.be/uPvmY8PLQBg)_._ The channel is such a hidden gem.

****[**Tribe**](https://amzn.to/2RZfwBr)**:** File this book in the “we should be skeptical of modernity” camp. The author makes the case that the design of tribal societies make us happier by giving us loyalty, belonging, and meaning. For all the benefits of modern society, it causes modern people to not feel necessary. I picked it up after my [nature retreat](https://www.sacredhunting.com/). Out there, it didn’t matter who you were. The summer heat doesn’t hold back against anybody and rattlesnakes don’t care what you do for a living. That forced our group to come together and led to the kind of communal bonding experience that cities make difficult. On this topic, my friend Joe Wells wrote an excellent essay arguing for [compulsory public service in America](https://perell.com/fellowship/compulsory-national-service/).

****[**Dominion**](https://amzn.to/3uS62X4)**:** I’m writing a long-form essay to explore how Christian metaphysics underpin the Western view of morality. To construct the ideas for my essay, I’m building upon [this stellar, 600-page piece of historical scholarship from Tom Holland.](https://amzn.to/3uS62X4) He argues that the Bible shaped Western thought, even if we’ve painted over those ideas with Enlightenment notions of truth and reason. On that note, it’s filled with golden nuggets like this: “That all men had been created equal, and endowed with an inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, were not remotely self-evident truths… The truest and ultimate seedbed of the American republic—no matter what some of those who had composed its founding documents might have cared to think—was the book of Genesis.” What a provocative argument. For an introduction, I recommend this [video interview](https://youtu.be/-qGfkFlZKgA) and this [book review](https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/december-2019/eternal-resurrection/).

****[**Free Parking**](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/parking-drives-housing-prices/618910/)**:** I joke that Americans travel to Europe to visit the kinds of cities they’ve made illegal to build in their home country. For now, we’ll focus on the high costs of parking. Making parking free drives up the cost of housing, [increases pollution](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2011/04/04/donald-shoup/free-parking-or-free-markets), and reduces urban density. This statistic stands out. The Los Angeles Philharmonic cost $274 million to build. Of that total, the first $100 million went to pay for the underground parking structure, which is not a cultural landmark. As Lewis Mumford wrote: “The right to access every building in a city by private motorcar in an age when everyone owns such a vehicle, is actually the right to destroy the city.”

[**Gardens: An Essay on the Human Condition**](https://onartandaesthetics.com/2016/10/01/gardens-an-essay-on-the-human-condition/)**:** This is one of my all-time favorite short essays. Like much of my favorite writing, it takes a mundane concept and makes you realize that it’s filled with depth. Gardens are everywhere in mythology. As a metaphor for life, it’s no coincidence that the bible story begins in The Garden of Eden. They balance order and chaos, life and death, nature and nurture. By holding opposites in harmonious tension, they are sites of epiphanies in the world of literature.

****[**The Enlightenment and Human Rights**](https://revolution.chnm.org/exhibits/show/liberty--equality--fraternity/enlightenment-and-human-rights)**:** Lots of people wrote to me with recommended links after I published the [_Why You’re Christian_](https://perell.com/essay/why-youre-christian/)essay_._ This was the best one. It shows the relationship between human rights and the Enlightenment, with a focus on the French Revolution. While writing the [_Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen)in 1789, French intellectuals wanted to uphold their ideas with reason instead of tradition. As a result, the words “France” or “French” never appear in the actual declaration.

****[**The Death of Ivan Ilyich:**](https://amzn.to/2YMaA2B)A heartfelt but sad meditation on life by Leo Tolstoy. It tells the story of a high-court judge in 19th century Russia who suffers from a terminal illness. Unlike Tolstoy’s other books, this one is short enough to read in one sitting.

****[**Geography and History**](https://unchartedterritories.substack.com/p/geography-is-the-chessboard-of-history)**:** It’s wild that we spent so much time memorizing dates in history class because they’re legit one of the least important things about history. Dates are important insofar as they give you a sense of timelines and overlapping events which may have influenced each other. But relative to how much attention they receive, they’re trivial. So why do we study them? Here’s a guess: Because they’re easy to grade on tests. This essay offers an alternative approach to studying history. And the opening sentence is so provocative and so attention-grabbing that I’m going to share it with my writing students: “We think we’re taught History. But we’re really taught Propaganda.” Yep, you just clicked.

****[**How Politics Became Pro Wrestling**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZpBvfBxLxc)**:** There’s an idea in professional wrestling called Kayfabe, where people pretend something is serious even though everybody knows it’s fake. This video, made by a [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) alumnus, is the best description I’ve seen. Ten minutes and you’ll forever enhance your understanding of contemporary, media-driven politics (which I also discuss in [this essay](https://perell.com/essay/what-the-hell-is-going-on/)).

****[**What the Mouse Knows**](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/what-the-mouse-knows)**:** A lovely short story from one of my favorite online writers: Simon Sarris. It explores the difference between the map and the territory, which I discussed in [_Expression is Compression_](https://perell.com/essay/expression-is-compression/)_._ Though we make maps to make sense of the world, actual reality is always more complicated than we think. That limitation presents opportunities if you know how to look at the world. As Ishmael_,_ a character in [_Moby Dick_](https://amzn.to/3y7cJGB) says: “It is not down in any map; true places never are.” Given that, we should find opportunities in map-less spaces and look for blindspots on the map of human knowledge.

****[**The Origins of Entrepreneurship**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846)**:** This paper explores the core personality traits of entrepreneurs. The authors identify a few, the most interesting of which is that they’re more likely to have done “illicit activities.” But the key line is that “the number one predictor of entrepreneurship is asymmetric information about skill levels.” By that, the authors are talking about people who are more talented than they are credentialed. For example, they’re the kinds of people who know how to build a business, even though they never went to college.

****[**Munda and Modia**](https://peakd.com/philosophy/@brianoflondon/mundia-and-modia-the-two-worlds-in-which-we-live)**:** Put this article in the “forever changed my worldview category.” The author argues that humans live in two worlds: one devoted to the immutable laws of the physical world and another devoted to the subjective laws of the social world. The world we spend most of our time in dictates our values and political orientation. In life, we create problems when we try to use strategies from one world to succeed in the other.

****[**Completing Girard**](https://johnathanbi.com/my-book/introduction)**:** Johnathan Bi, one of the smartest up-and-coming philosophers I know, published a short book about Rene Girard. It’s all available for free on his site.

****[**Martin Gurri Summary**](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/shorter-martin-gurri/)**:** If you asked me to name a writer who is virtually unknown today but who will be hailed in history books, Martin Gurri would be my answer. He’s absolutely brilliant. His book_,_ [_The Revolt of the Public_](https://amzn.to/3eYGKRQ)_,_ was the inspiration behind my _[What the Hell is Going On](https://perell.com/essay/what-the-hell-is-going-on/)_ essay. His book is worth reading in full, but [this 2-minute summary](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/shorter-martin-gurri/) is an excellent synopsis of his thinking.

[**On Urbanism**](https://threadreaders.com/thread/embed/883181352933236736)**:** An epic Twitter thread on the design characteristics of traditional urbanism. Though humanity has progressed on many fronts, we have undoubtedly regressed in our ability to build cities. Modern cities have none of the charm as the ones we built in Europe 500 years ago. [This thread](https://threadreaders.com/thread/embed/883181352933236736) is the best explanation of what modern cities are lacking.

**Devon Zuegel’s City Writing:** I’ve long admired Devon Zuegel’s writing. We [recorded a podcast together](https://perell.com/podcast/devon-zuegel/) a while back about cities and urban planning. This week, she [published some field notes](https://devonzuegel.com/post/field-notes-miami) about what it’s like to live in Miami. With a 58% foreign-born population, Miami is the only major US city with a majority foreign-born population. Other topics include its immigrant spirit, the extravagant architecture, and the diversity of neighborhoods from South Beach to Little Havana. Devon’s also written about [Bangalore](https://devonzuegel.com/post/a-day-in-bangalore), [Jakarta](https://devonzuegel.com/post/a-day-in-jakarta), and [Beijing](https://devonzuegel.com/post/a-day-in-beijing).

****[**A Lovely Book of Aphorisms**](https://amzn.to/2QMetDE)**:** I don’t know how I found this book, but I’m glad I did. It’s a collection of aphorisms (honestly, they’re basically tweets) about topics like writing, psychology, and economics. Of course, my favorite ones are about writing: (1)”No style guide can address the chief defect in writing, which is having nothing to say” and (2) “People say they can’t draw when they mean they can’t see, and that they can’t write when they mean they can’t think.” This one is so fun.

****[**Manufacturing Consent**](https://amzn.to/3thexuf)**:** Noam Chomsky is one of the most thought-provoking intellectuals alive today. He’s at his best when he’s talking about how the media controls thought. In one interview, a reporter asked him: “Do you really think I’m self-censoring right now?” Chomsky replied: “I’m not saying that you think you’re self-censoring. I’m sure you believe every word you’re saying. But I’m saying that if you believed something different, you wouldn’t be sitting where you’re sitting.” For more, I recommend this [explainer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent), [this YouTube interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf-tQYcZGM4), or [Chomsky’s book on the subject](https://amzn.to/3cnYi8D).

**Chartism:** I can’t get this idea out of my head. Apparently, it goes back to the British male [suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartism) movement in the mid-19th century and the work of Thomas Carlyle, who was [critical of Chartism’s hold over decision-making](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5oQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP7#v=onepage&q&f=false). Here’s how I interpret the practical implications of the idea: Policymakers fall somewhere on the spectrum of pro-chart and anti-chart. Pro-chartists think that data can explain the world, and the more we have, the better. But anti-chartists think that relentless data accumulation is misguided because it offers false certainty and misses the big picture interpretation. As the saying goes: “More fiction is written in Excel than Word.”

****[**The Holy Church of Christ Without Christ**](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-holy-church-of-christ-without)**:** I’m recommending this one as much for the writing style as the content itself. I was reflecting on my education when I realized that I went through K-12 and then all of college without ever reading the Gospels. Even if I’m not religious, that’s insane. Word-for-word, it’s hard to find a document that’s shaped Western thinking more. Among other things, such as the myopia of utilitarianism (ruling by Excel spreadsheet) and the relationship between science and belief, [this essay explains why](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-holy-church-of-christ-without).

****[**Philosophize This and Critical Theory**](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)**:** [The Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School) is one of the most important philosophical hubs of the 20th century. It began in Germany, but most of the philosophers ended up at Columbia University in New York. They were critical of capitalism and Marxism, so they tried to reimagine both of them. But unfortunately, even though their ideas are worthwhile, their writing me want to bang my head into a wall of nails. For help, [I turned to Stephen West’s excellent 7-part series](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/frankfurt-school-intro), which is the best explainer I’ve found about the Frankfurt School. His archives are impressive. You may also enjoy his episodes about [Hannah Arendt](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/banality-of-evil), [Carl Schmitt](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/anti-liberalism-pt-1), and [Gilles Deleuze](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/deleuze-pt-1).

****[**Human Nature**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1365445813644783617?s=20)**:** This video is a masterclass in psychology. The first person to do something always looks weird. People laugh. Then somebody else joins. Then the crowds come in, and the person who started the whole thing goes from looking like a goon to looking like a genius.

****[**Social Status**](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/)**:** Humans are wired to think about social status. E.O. Wilson argued that prestige took off spectacularly because our ancestors lived in semi-permanent home-bases that needed to be guarded collectively. Protecting the fort gave them an incentive to team up and cooperate. This article by Kevin Simler is the best read about our uniquely human ability to quantify prestige and the way we lust for more of it. It builds upon the work of Joe Heinrich, [who I interviewed last year](https://perell.com/podcast/joe-henrich-what-makes-society-smart/).

****[**The Age of Entitlement**](https://amzn.to/2QmF6iy)**:** A take on American history so different from what I learned in high school. People say it’s a critique of the Civil Rights movement, but I don’t think that’s it. The author is actually quite supportive of it. Rather, it’s an illustration of the unintended consequences of it: rising federal power, bureaucratic bloat, and increasing government debt. Here’s an example. Federal loans and grants to college students, adjusted for inflation were $800 million in 1963-64, $15 billion in 1973-74, and $157 billion in 2010-11. Moreover, students at the University of Phoenix, the largest collector of Pell Grant tuition, now owe $35 billion in taxpayer-backed federal loans. To add insult to injury, their default rate is higher than their graduation rate. That’s bonkers. If you prefer an interview with the author, [here’s a good one](https://youtu.be/36-nBl5uBmc).

****[**Paris Review Interviews**](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews)**:** When I think about epic series from classic media publications, the Paris Review interviews come to mind. They’ve interviewed some of the greatest minds of the past century: Kurt Vonnegut, Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, Ernest Hemingway, and Robert Caro come to mind. And they are consistently the best interviews I’ve seen of them. You’ll need a subscription to read them, but damn, it’s worth it. This week, I read interviews with the documentary film-maker [Frederick Wiseman](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/7210/the-art-of-documentary-no-1-frederick-wiseman) and novelist [Milan Kundera](https://theparisreview.org/interviews/2977/the-art-of-fiction-no-81-milan-kundera).

****[**An Intro to Marshall McLuhan**](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-149-on-media-pt-2-marshall-mcluhan): If there’s a recurring theme in my work, it’s that more people should study McLuhan’s ideas. Here’s an excellent podcast introduction from Philosophize This, with a [full transcript](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-149-transcript).

**Lewis Mumford**: What an under-rated talent. Mumford is the forefather of the media and technology studies movement that gained steam in the mid-20th-century. I’ve been reading his book, [_Technics and Civilization_](https://amzn.to/39Wz2TV). The owner of my local Austin bookstore knows my taste, so she also picked [_Architecture as a Home for Man_](https://amzn.to/2Nkwd7s) up for me, which I plan to read afterward.

[**Shop Class as Soulcraft**](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft)**:** One of the best ways to find good things to read is to look for the essays that were so good that they [eventually became books](https://amzn.to/3c6yZHQ). To date, I haven’t seen a list of such essays, but I’ll share it here if I find one. This essay reveals the downsides in the transition from physical labor to knowledge work. Manual trades have lost their honor and the material world has lost its mystique.

****[**Thomas Aquinas**](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/06/060122-5.htm)**:** One of my main intellectual explorations of late has been the way Greek ideas have fused into the Christian worldview. Plato’s influence came through Augustine, and Aristotle’s influence came through Aquinas. Most thought-provoking to me is Aquinas‘ idea that philosophy and theology don’t contradict. Instead, he believes that they play complementary roles in the quest for truth. He saw human knowledge as a pyramid with science at the base, philosophy above it, and theology at the top. Thus, he believes that faith does not contradict nature, science, or human knowledge. Together, he says that they cooperate in the advancement of truth.

[**Thorstein Velben’s Theory of the Leisure Class (Updated)**](https://quillette.com/2019/11/16/thorstein-veblens-theory-of-the-leisure-class-a-status-update/)**:** Written by one of my favorite up-and-coming writers, [Rob Henderson](https://www.robkhenderson.com/) (whose entire body of work is worth exploring). This article is an introduction to his theory of “luxury beliefs,” where high-class people adopt beliefs that take a toll on the lower class but don’t cost them anything. To prove his argument, he points to [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsp.2620) that shows that the desire for status is a positive feedback loop, where the highest status people are the most likely to want _even more_ status.

[**Gut Feelings**](https://amzn.to/2NjGYHK)**:** Michael Polanyi once said: “We know more than we can tell.” All of us have centuries of evolutionary wisdom inside of us that we ignore whenever we ignore our intuition. That’s why I’ve long been skeptical of the way we bash cognitive biases. There’s wisdom in things like the sunk cost bias and the availability bias. Though we should educate ourselves on the shortcomings of intuitive thinking, [this book](https://amzn.to/2NjGYHK) argues that we should give heuristics and gut feelings more respect. If you’re looking for something shorter, [this article](https://www.edge.org/conversation/gerd_gigerenzer-smart-heuristics) is a good introduction to the author’s thinking.

****[**Carl Schmitt’s Political Theology**](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/can-schmitts-political-theology-be-redeemed/)**:** Dense, but for all the right reasons. Though Carl Schmitt is quite a controversial political thinker, his work has been recommended to me many times. This introduction focuses on the Venn diagram of political theory and Judeo-Christian thought. The main claim is that the contemporary political environment relies on a Christian substrate. If so, the justification for many of our laws come not from the Enlightenment, but from Christianity. I particularly like Schmitt’s definition of sovereignty: “The person who gets to decide upon the exception to the rule.” If you want to see who really holds power, look there.

****[**Einstein’s Dreams**](https://amzn.to/385MnK8): A splendid collection of short stories from the philosopher-physicist Alan Lightman. All of them are about time, relativity, and physics as if they were the dreams of Albert Einstein. My favorite one is about [body time vs. mechanical time](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1299778651118952449?s=20). Body time is the world of hunger, moods, and circadian rhythms, while mechanical time is the world of clocks and alarms. It‘d be fun to switch between these time speeds throughout the year. To help myself enter the calm flow of body time, I’ve deliberately chosen not to put any clocks in my home.

**LSD and Acid in the 1960s**: I’ve spent the week reading Joan Didion’s _[Slouching Towards Bethlehem](https://amzn.to/3rHGvOO)_ and Tom Wolfe’s [_Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_](https://amzn.to/2X3KTte)_._ Both are reflections on a time when the government experimented with these powerful substances, and drugs took over parts of San Francisco’s social life. Didion’s take is the pessimistic one, Wolfe’s is more optimistic. The movement began in 1959, when the US government began testing the effects of acid and LSD on its citizens as part of a CIA mind control program called [Project MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra). For a video introduction, I recommend [this YouTube documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh2kK5IfS-8).

****[**Beauty is the Privilege We Never Talk About**](https://medium.com/@sfard/the-greatest-privilege-we-hardly-talk-about-beauty-7db3f70c1116): Being beautiful makes life much, much easier. First, we’ll start with the obvious. Speed dating research [shows](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/dating-and-mating/201701/why-physical-attraction-matters-and-when-it-might-not) that beauty is the most important factor in choosing a mate. But attractive people are [also](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/49392/2/MPRA_paper_49392.pdf) more likely to be hired for a job and seen as competent. This quote from the article stands out, even though it’s so extreme that I’m skeptical of it: “This bias for beauty can cause real harm. In a meta analysis of the role of attractiveness in criminal sentencing, it was found that unattractive people received 120–305 percent longer sentences than attractive people. As a comparison, another study found that black people received 6–20 percent longer sentences than white people. Yes, in criminal sentencing, looks were over 10x more important than race.” Beauty, then, is the ultimate privilege.

**The Dream of Philosophy:** A two-part series about the history of modern philosophy. The first book, [_The Dream of Reason_](https://amzn.to/3po2tEG)_,_ begins in Ancient Greece and goes to the Renaissance. The second,[_The Dream of Enlightenment_](https://amzn.to/3poqJq9), picks up where the first one left off and focuses on The Enlightenment. The ideas are clearly written but aren’t dumbed down, which is what you want from a book about philosophy.

****[**The Imitation of Christ**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_of_Christ)**:** In honor of Christmas, this is the most widely-read Christian devotional book outside of the Bible. It was published in the 15th century, and by 1650, it was one of the most published books in existence with a grand total of… 745 copies. The book was published anonymously. With humility and inspired by Christian teachings, the author wrote: “One should love to be unknown… Do not let the writer’s authority or learning influence you, be it little or great, but let the love of pure truth attract you to read. Do not ask ‘Who said this?’ but pay attention to what is said.” Amen to that.

****[**Pete Davis Harvard Commencement Speech**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHMHK4i_oLg)**:** My life improved dramatically once I stopped chasing optionality and committed to the things that mattered to me most. The catalyst was an article called [_The Trouble With Optionality_](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1342300065096998917?s=20)_,_ which I can’t recommend enough. On the same theme, this commencement speech is a critique of what the philosopher Zygmunt Bauman called “Liquid Modernity,” a state of ambivalent identities where people switch between identities without committing to any of them, just so they can “keep their options open.”

**Abraham Joshua Heschel:** I discovered Heschel in the Fall on a [recommendation from Rabbi David Wolpe](https://perell.com/podcast/rabbi-david-wolpe-jewish-wisdom/). And boy, am I glad I did. He’s an artist with words. I started with [_The Sabbath_](https://amzn.to/38vxsaW)_,_ and last night, I read the vast majority of [_Man’s Quest for God_](https://amzn.to/38xLAAx) in one sitting. No matter your faith, you will enjoy his books if you’re feeling contemplative.

**[Gardens Need Walls: On Boundaries, Ritual, and Beauty](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/):** Walls are everywhere in nature. In complex systems, boundaries are everywhere. Ancestral, well-established solutions to basic problems like food and housing also solve higher-level problems like the need for social cohesion. New technologies tend to solve basic problems, but not higher-level ones. 

**[Gardens: An Essay on the Human Condition](https://onartandaesthetics.com/2016/10/01/gardens-an-essay-on-the-human-condition/):** It is no coincidence that the bible story begins in The Garden of Eden. Gardens are a metaphor for life. They balance order and chaos, life and death, nature and nurture.

**[Definite Optimism as Human Capital](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/): ** We can nurture optimism by developing a greater appreciation for industry and reaching for higher economic growth. Pushing forward the technological frontier isn’t somebody else’s problem. It’s our responsibility. 

**[The Big Here and the Long Now](http://longnow.org/essays/big-here-long-now/):** Brian Eno is the ultimate polymath. Part musician, part intellectual, Eno teamed up with Stewart Brand to found the Long Now Foundation and change how humans think about time. The Long Now is the recognition that the precise moment you’re in grows out of the past and is a seed for the future. The longer your sense of Now, the more past and future it includes. I also recommend [Eno’s interviews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FHJH19_e4)

**[The Founder’s Paradox by Peter Thiel](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup):** Extreme innovators are full of contradictions. They are extreme insiders _and_ extreme outsiders, gods and scapegoats. Inspired by Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory, Peter Thiel’s “Founder Paradox” will radically transform how you think about talent, creativity and personality traits.

**[Peter Zeihan on the Future of Geopolitics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0eJK4Avk2M):** Peter Zeihan shares a narrative-defying perspective on the future of the world. A geopolitical strategist, Zeihan weaves insights about demographics, security, and global energy into a charming and humorous talk, which is as fun as it is interesting.

**[Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/):** Most books are extended articles. This article is a shortened book. It’s jam-packed with powerful information. It’s the best introduction to systems I’ve ever seen. Systems are everywhere, and if you want to change them, the author recommends 12 places to intervene, and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each one.

[**Jaques Ellul and Marshall McLuhan**](https://youtu.be/CcsU7WMfr3o)**:** I’ve been pulling at a bizarre intellectual paradox. I am simultaneously a strong believer in progress, but believe we ignore the wisdom of tradition at our own peril. Drawing on the two edges of a single string makes me a progressive and a reactionary. I’ve been studying mid-20th-century technological theory to resolve the tension. I’ve cited McLuhan in a handful of essays, and Ellul’s ideas mesh with McLuhan’s observations. [This is the best introduction](https://youtu.be/CcsU7WMfr3o) I’ve found to the similarities and differences between them. You’ll enjoy the ideas, even if you don’t have any background knowledge on Ellul or McLuhan.

**The Cult of Optionality:** I was afraid of commitment for too long. I thought that committing to a project for multiple years would limit the number of opportunities at my disposal. But the opposite has happened. Branding myself as “The Writing Guy” and focusing full-time on Write of Passage (which I intend to do for the next decade) has paradoxically increased the number of professional opportunities available to me. Luckily, many authors have made this point more eloquently than I just did. I recommend this [piece from Byrne Hobart](https://byrnehobart.medium.com/optionality-is-for-innumerate-cowards-f2c5a759b607), this one from [Applied Divinity Studies](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/asymmetric/index.html), and especially this one from a [Harvard professor named Mihir Desai](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/25/desai-commencement-ed/).

[**Dishwashers**](https://www.aier.org/article/lets-talk-about-ghastly-dishwashers/)**:** There are two ways to read this article. First, you can read it for the literal interpretation. Dishwashers aren’t as powerful as they used to be. They used to wash our dishes in less than an hour, and leave them shiny and clean. But today, it takes 3-4 hours to clean your dishes, and dishwashers don’t work as well as they used to. That brings me to the second way you can read this article. Deep down, it’s a story about the downsides of regulation and environmentalism. Read the article with both lenses.

**Michael Polanyi:** A [very smart friend](https://twitter.com/iamlikelywrong) turned me onto Polanyi’s ideas. Most of his work is about the intersection between markets, capitalism, and society, but I also enjoyed learning about [Polanyi’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polanyi%E2%80%99s_paradox) — the idea that we know more than we can explain. If you’re interested in Polanyi, start with this essay called [_The Uruk Machine_](https://samzdat.com/2017/08/28/the-uruk-machine/)_,_ which also talks about the work of James Scott and Eric Hoffer.

**Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act:** One of the core failings of the U.S. political system is that we focus so much on the executive branch that we lose sight of crucial pieces of legislation in other parts of the government. These days, certain lawmakers are fighting to repeal Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act. Basically, it protects publishers of information from the repercussions of distributing ideas created by another content provider. I’ll let you be the judge of whether or not repealing the act is a good idea. But to help you learn about it, here’s the [Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230), [the law itself](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230), and an explanation from the [_Federal Communications Commission_](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2020/10/21/fccs-authority-interpret-section-230-communications-act)_._

****[**The Unbearable Lightness of Being**](https://amzn.to/3mAHrRg)**:** Damn, what a magnificent book. The story isn’t very good, but only because it’s a canvas to explore the philosophy of love and the tensions of a life well-lived. This quote is a wonderful summary of what makes the book so magical: “The heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But … the heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become. Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes a man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant.” Earlier this year, one of my favorite painters told me he‘ll never live a luxurious life because it’ll distance him from the human experience. Pain can be challenging, he said. But it can also magnify the experience of being alive.

**The Psychology of Human Misjudgment:** This one is all the way on the opposite spectrum of life. Charlie Munger gave this speech at Harvard University in 1995. In it, he outlines shows how humans make bad decisions by drawing upon lessons from behavioral psychology. You can [read the full transcript](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/) or [listen to the audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws&feature=emb_title).

****[**Designing a New Old Home**](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41)**:** Simon Sarris is the best online writer I’ve found in the past few months. He writes with a level of soul that you rarely find on the Internet, which I aspire to whenever I tap my keyboard. This [two](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41) [part](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-2-2a5ea1a1b2b3) series outlines his thought-process behind designing a rural home in New Hampshire, from ceiling heights, to room sizes, to the carpets in the kitchen. On his recommendation, I’ve also been enjoying a book called [_Get Your House Right_](https://amzn.to/3rbj3t6)_,_ which applies the wisdom of traditional architecture to modern living.

[**Solitude and Leadership**](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/)**:** This speech is fantastic. It’s about why leaders need to spend time alone, even though most people think of solitude as the antithesis of leadership. It was delivered by William Deresiewicz at West Point. It’s as spiritual as it is insightful.

****[**The Disadvantages of an Elite Education**](https://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/)**:** I’ve always liked William Deresiewicz. I’ve recommended his _[Solitude and Leadership](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/)_ essay, but he’s at his best while writing about higher education. He spent two dozen years at Yale and Columbia, where he dissected the psychology of elite students. Though almost every American student wants to attend an Ivy League school, this essay highlights the drawbacks of doing so, and he does it with awe-inducing prose.

****[**On Re-doing Things**](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-redoing-things)**:** [Kevin Kelly](https://www.perell.com/podcast/kevin-kelly-seeing-the-future) once said: “To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.” The essay explores this idea in a kind of soul-driven fashion that you rarely see on the Internet. It made me realize that heart-wrenching creative work is driven by two forces: the desire to produce and the pain of actually doing it, and only once the thirst of desire is stronger than the anguish of hard work can you do great work.

**Roger Scruton:** One of the leading conservative thinkers died, and I knew almost nothing about him. I wanted to change that, so I spent time watching Roger Scruton’s interviews. In particular, I enjoyed this [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omAvX8hGX0Y) and [this written summary](https://www.spiked-online.com/2015/12/10/these-left-thinkers-have-destroyed-the-intellectual-life/).

[**Mimetic Theory**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePortal/comments/cfmtq2/comment/euiv3op?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)**:** This is an unbelievable explanation of Mimetic Theory, and it’s probably the best one I’ve ever seen. The theory was developed by Rene Girard, a cultural anthropologist who history will remember as one of the greatest scholars of all-time. If you’re looking for a video summary, I recommend this [series of five interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Y8dVVV4To) with Girard himself. Peter Thiel and Girard were close friends. Thiel spoke at Girard’s funeral, and I wrote extensively about the influence of Mimetic Theory on Thiel’s worldview in [this essay](https://perell.com/blog/peter-thiel).

[**John David Ebert**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXeMt9lyRFY)**:** Ebert is a brilliant orator, with a rich understanding of observant, but under-the-radar thinkers like Marshall McLuhan and Oswald Spengler. Ebert’s work is a fusion of religious studies, media studies, and contemporary philosophy. Start with [this serious of videos on Marshall McLuhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXeMt9lyRFY). And if they catch you, check out [Ebert’s collection of published books](https://amzn.to/2vxEfky).

**Interfluidity:** This is an obscure but fantastic blog. It sits at the intersection of government, economics, and technology. In particular, I enjoyed this essay called [_Economic Geography of a Universal Basic Income_](https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6674.html)_,_ which argues against the economic consensus that we should help as many people move to cities as possible. To date, it’s the best counter-argument I have seen against my essay, [_Grow the Merry-Go-Round_](https://perell.com/blog/grow-the-merry-go-round)_._

**[Antonin Scalia on American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0&feature=youtu.be):** Scalia’s opening remarks on the Role of Judges under the U.S Constitution. In his remarks, Scalia discusses the importance of grid lock and distributed power in government. 

**[The Liquid Self:](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227105833/https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self/)** A prescient essay from 2013 which predicted the shift in identity brought by the Internet. It re-thinks the permanence of the social media profile and imagines the possibility of a living, fluid, and always changing identity made possible by the Internet. The post used to live on [Snapchat’s website.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227105833/https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self/) If you’re interested in Evan Spiegel’s early thinking, I also recommend [this 4-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGXIQAHLnA) about social media culture and online communication.

[**The Electricity Metaphor**](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_bezos_the_electricity_metaphor_for_the_web_s_future/transcript?language=en): I’m surprised that this 2007 TED talk is so rarely shared. In it, Jeff Bezos uses electricity as a metaphor for the Internet’s future by comparing the dot-com boom and bust not to the Gold Rush, but to the early days of the power industry.

****[**Christopher Hitchens Interview**](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/news-and-city-life/2009/12/christopher-hitchens)**:** This one is a conversation between a unitarian minister and the atheist philosopher Christopher Hitchens. It’s worth reading, partially because it’s so awkward. The conversation cuts to one of the core questions of modern religious thinking: should you think about religious stories literally or metaphorically? And if you treat them metaphorically, are you really religious?

[**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy**](https://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html): This is my go-to resource for everything philosophy. It’s like a better philosophy-focused Wikipedia with more information than you’ll ever be able to consume about the major ideas and thinkers. Fair warning… if you like philosophy, this is a black hole.

****[**The Problem with Human Rights**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhRBsJYWR8Q)**:** Trigger warning: this video might shatter your worldview. At least, it did for me. The substrate of human rights rests on Judeo-Christian theology, and in particular the idea of _imago dei_ (every human is made in the image of God), which is one of the biggest reasons I’ve been drawn towards faith. So with that, take a big ol’ swig of water and confront this red pill.

[**Postscript on Societies of Control**](http://pages.akbild.ac.at/kdm/_media/_pdf/Gilles%20Deleuze%20-%20Postscript%20on%20the%20Societies%20of%20Control.pdf)**:** I’d like to read more Giles Deleuze in the future, but this was a good start. In this short essay, he talks about the transition of capitalism from production to financialization, and from a disciplinary society to a society of control. Before reading, [here’s a summary](https://twitter.com/jeremygiffon/status/1232800033336176647?s=20). I also recommend [John David Ebert’s lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pH--FtP0j4&list=PL45CC899A2941BF33) on Deleuze and Guattari.

[**Based Deleuze**](https://theotherlifenow.com/based-deleuze/)**:** Justin Murphy published a book called _Based Deleuze,_ about a philosopher named [Gilles Deleuze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze), who history will remember as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Depending on the tier you choose, the book comes with a series of lectures from Justin himself. I recommend Murphy’s [introduction](https://twitter.com/jmrphy/status/1211019550633943044?s=20) because Deleuze is notoriously difficult you understand (you know, those French philosophers), and his talks will help you ease into the material. If you’re interested in philosophy, you might also enjoy Johannes Achill Niederhauser’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsQqlrzoc-K32DE-Wh-roA) about classical philosophy.

[**The Nuclear Family**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/)**:** If you read one link, this should be it. It’s an exceptional explanation of why big families aren’t as common as they used to be. Many of the major political battles, such as free healthcare and universal basic income, are downstream from the changes in family structure that author David Brooks describes in this article.

[**Justin Murphy**](https://jmrphy.net/)**:** I’m wildly impressed with this up-and-coming philosopher. Murphy’s work is a reaction to the intellectual claustrophobia of academia. I can say with 100% certainty that you won’t agree with all his ideas. Nevertheless, I admire his intellectual courage, so I hope more philosophers can use the Internet to pursue fringe ideas that need to be discussed. Start with his [podcast](https://jmrphy.libsyn.com/), his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmrphy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) account, or his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfrlXVXz-pT9AmmDELhpyOw).

**Aaron Lewis:** When it comes to the intersection of technology, culture, and society, this guy is one of the most under-rated thinkers out there. In particular, I recommend his articles on [post-truth in the age of the Internet](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/), and [writing pseudonymously on the Internet](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/02/18/being-your-selves-identity-r-and-d-on-the-pseudonymous-internet/).

[**Battling to the End**](https://medium.com/@ryanpflynn/ren%C3%A9-girard-battling-to-the-end-quotes-891b535b43ed)**:** If you’re interested in Rene Girard, start with his interviews instead of his books. This heuristic applies to many great thinkers who are hard to understand because people tend to be easier to understand in spoken word than text. Here’s a [collection of quotes from _Battling to the End_](https://medium.com/@ryanpflynn/ren%C3%A9-girard-battling-to-the-end-quotes-891b535b43ed)_,_ a series of conversations about the apocalyptic threats hanging over our planet and the mimetic laws of violence.

[**Generic Drugs**](https://peterattiamd.com/katherineeban/)**:** A fascinating podcast with Peter Attia and Katherine Eban discussing widespread fraud in the generic drug industry. Attia hosts one of my favorite podcasts. Eban is an investigative journalist and the author of Bottle of Lies, which outlines the history of corruption in the generic drugs industry through the lens of an Indian drug company named Ranbaxy. This episode is an absolute roller-coaster.

[**The Moral Equivalent of War**](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/moral.html)**:** An 1906 essay from William James where he argues society needs a way to re-create the strengthening, hardening, and uniting factors that war provides. Without a “moral equivalent of war,” our society will degenerate. The essay inspired organized national service programs like the Peace Corps, VISTA, and AmeriCorps.

[**Nassim Taleb’s Book Reviews**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMHNR4MRTDLMBOOT6Q7LX2WP5YA/ref=cm_cr_srp_mb_gw_top?ie=UTF8%20)**:** If you’re looking for book recommendations, I recommend Nassim Taleb’s book reviews on Amazon. If you’re interested in evolution, investing, or statistics, this page is for you. Of all the books, [_Explaining Social Behavior_](https://amzn.to/2XLVcUr)caught my attention the most.

**Eric Weinstein’s Old Edge Articles:** First, I need to make sure you’re familiar with Eric Weinstein’s podcast, [_The Portal_](https://zoom.us/j/619662575)_._ If not, stop what you’re doing and start listening as soon as you can. I recommend the [opening episode with Peter Thiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s) or his conversation with [Anna Khackiyan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs8NGrWs3mc). But I also recommend the articles Eric wrote for Edge magazine. You’ll [find all the articles here.](https://www.edge.org/memberbio/eric_r_weinstein) I recommend this article on [excellence](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/23879) or this one about [string theory](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25547).

[**Seeking Wisdom**](https://amzn.to/34IlEQb)**:** Peter Bevelin is one of the most under-rated authors there is. His book [_Seeking Wisdom_](https://amzn.to/2XLVcUr)was one of the first books that made me realize how little I knew about the world. Building off the ideas of people like Charles Darwin and Charlie Munger, it shocked me into intellectual curiosity. If this is your kind of thing, I recommend a 75-minute speech by Charlie Munger called [_The Psychology of Human Misjudgement_](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/) which I listened to on repeat all week.

[**Cuck Philosophy**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkzHxIcfoEr69MWBdo0ppg)**:** This YouTube channel is a collection of 10-20 minute videos about different aspects of postmodernist theory. Start with [this video about Baudrillard and _The Matrix_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf9J35yzM3E)or [this one about societies of control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_i8_WuyqAY)

[**Jose Ricon**](https://nintil.com/on-building/)**:** This is one of the most under-rated blogs I know. Jose writes about the intersection of science and technology with more thoroughness as anybody I know. Imagine if all journalism was this good. To start, I recommend his deep-dives into [longevity](https://nintil.com/longevity/), [the slowdown in physics](https://nintil.com/is-useful-physics-over/), and [Bloom’s two-sigma problem for mastery learning](https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma/). This blog will make you say “I can’t believe this is free.”

[**Jacobin Magazine**](https://www.jacobinmag.com/)**:** On my journey to engage with Marx’s ideas, one of my most conservative friends turned me onto this socialist magazine covering economics, culture, and politics. It’s excellent. I enjoyed [this essay](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/04/precarity-french-labor-market-gig-economy-precariat) on the history of the gig economy and its influence on the French labor market.

**Beauty:** When Roger Scruton passed away, Nassim Taleb [wrote](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1216461130253656064.html): “Fiercely independent, [Roger Scruton] was one of the last thinkers who used their own head.” I didn’t know who he was, so I watched as many of his interviews on YouTube as I could find. I also read his book [Introduction to _Beauty_: _A Very Short Introduction_](https://amzn.to/3bWeM4z) and watched his [documentary on the same subject](https://vimeo.com/128428182) — both of which are excellent. Start with the documentary, though. It’s superb.

**Breaking Smart:** Venkatesh Rao is brilliant and this is his best piece of work. With only eight reviews on Amazon, it’s the ultimate hidden gem. The book is about how “software is eating the world,” and it includes topics like the dismantling of the traditional life script and the evolution of online work. You can [purchase the book on Kindle](https://amzn.to/2YoT59i) or [read the entire thing for free online](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/). These ideas are a decade ahead of their time.

[**David Harvey**](http://davidharvey.org/reading-capital/): This is the best introduction to Karl Marx I’ve found. I binge-listened to the [_Reading Capital_](http://davidharvey.org/reading-capital/)podcast series and bought Harvey’s book, [_A Companion to Capital_](https://amzn.to/2T4cUQ7). They are both fantastic. The problem with studying Marx is most modern scholars twist his ideas into a political agenda. But Harvey does none of that. He focuses on the text instead. If you want to read Marx, you can visit [Marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/) instead of buying his books.

**Horseshoe Theory**: I see this idea everywhere. Extreme opposites have a tendency to look the same. For example, a far-right movement and a far-left movement can be equally violent or desire a similar outcome. People on both sides are more similar to each other than they are to people in the center. [Here’s a summary](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory).

**Common Knowledge**: One of the most important ideas I know. Often, it’s not enough for one person to know something. The dynamics of a situation change when everybody knows that everybody knows something. That’s why sermons are repetitive and often have a call-and-response style. Read [_Ads Don’t Work that Way_](https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/)if you want something quick or [_Rational Ritual_](https://amzn.to/3duu4Oi)if you want a book-length treatment of the idea.

[**Tools for Conversation**](http://a9.io/glue-comic/)**:** A fun and very detailed re-imagination of what chat messaging should look like. Basically, the structure of modern messaging platforms doesn’t reflect the way the brain works or the way people engage with ideas in real life.

[**Google Platforms Rant**](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)**:** This might be the most famous memo in recent Silicon Valley history. It was written by a Google engineer named [Steve Yegge](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge). Focusing on the differences between Google and Amazon (where he used to work), the memo was supposed to be shared internally, but it accidentally leaked.

****[**Oil Industry Propaganda**](https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/)**:** The idea of a “personal carbon footprint” may have come from a 2005 marketing campaign from British Petroleum, which was designed to deflect responsibility away from corporations and onto consumers. For more, here’s a [short history](https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/) and [here’s a](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/14/opinion/14kenney.html) [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/14/opinion/14kenney.html) opinion piece written by a guy who worked on the advertising campaign. For more on the subject of propaganda, I recommend a documentary called [The Century of the Self.](https://youtu.be/DnPmg0R1M04)

[**Predicting Horse Races**](https://ma.tt/2017/11/adam-robinson-on-understanding/)**:** When it comes to predicting the future,too much information can be a bad thing. This transcript tells the story of a study done by a world-class psychologist named Paul Slovic in 1974 and shows how horse gamblers can deceive themselves as the amount of information increases. Substitute horse gamblers with investors and this article becomes even more interesting. (If you’re interested in predictions, check out [Dominic Cummings’ review of _Superforecasters_](https://dominiccummings.com/2016/11/24/a-review-of-tetlocks-superforecasting-2015/)).

**OkCupid Dating Blog**: This blog is so interesting that most of the posts were deleted. Here’s the backstory: an online dating platform named OKCupid shared its best insights on online dating, and focused more on the data than political correctness. [Here’s a Reddit thread about the blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwern/comments/aapn1l/okcupid_blog_archives/). In particular, I recommend the articles about [people lying about their height](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/itseemsthatwomenlieabouttheirheightmorethanmendo.html) and [attractiveness distributions between men and women.](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/yourlooksandyourinbox.html)

[**Seth Godin’s Blog**](https://seths.blog/top-100/): Nobody writes short articles better than Seth Godin. If you’re looking for something to read, start with his top 100 articles. They’re a masterclass in clear writing. You can also check out my interview with him [here.](https://perell.com/podcast/seth-godin-writing-every-day)

[**The Love that Lays the Swale in Rows**](http://www.roughtype.com/?p=8783): Woah, what a fantastic essay. It’s an excerpt from the last chapter of Nicholas Carr’s book, [_The Glass Cage_](https://amzn.to/2TRAbox). To date, it’s the best argument I’ve seen against automation. The whole piece is thought-provoking, and the writing quality is the cherry on top.

[**The Right to Useful Unemployment**](https://amzn.to/3cgHOLw): Every now and then, it is my duty to put Ivan Illych on your radar. He wrote in the 1970s, but his ideas still feel prescient. He argues that expertise and technology are Faustian Bargains — deals with the devil that destroy communities, tarnish mental health, and dehumanize people. You won’t necessarily agree with him, but his books will introduce you to critiques you won’t find elsewhere.

[**A Critique of Stoicism**](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/stoicism-is-not-enough-34181d34264c): Simon Sarris is one of my favorite up-and-coming Internet writers, and this essay is an excellent place to begin with his work. It’s a critique of Stoicism, using David Foster Wallace’s _[This is Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhhC_N6Bm_s)_ speech. Sarris’ essay is the best place to begin, but if you want to dive deeper down the Stoicism rabbit hole, [read this essay on the ethics of Stoicism](https://medium.com/1517/the-inadequacies-of-the-invincible-919e768f3106).

[**Nassim Taleb Statistical Videos**](https://youtu.be/_ZLrZc9NPVw)**:** I’ll outsource this recommendation to some rando in the YouTube comments: “Taleb is the only guy who can make a 3-minute video, and get 30 minutes of watch time per video.” That’s exactly right. Start with [this 3-minute video on single point estimates in statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZLrZc9NPVw&feature=youtu.be), then [browse the entire channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uY6yLP9BS4BUc9BSc0Jww).

[**Johnathan Bi**](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries): This guy is one of the best up-and-coming writers I know. He writes exceptional book summaries, such as this one on Alexis de Tocqueville’s [_Democracy in America_](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/democracy-in-america). If that’s not your style, I recommend this one on Rene Girard’s [_Battling to the End_](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/anfz349vjkgzm5kjq3tz6pdc7yhmc8) or this short one on Locke’s [_Second Treatise of Government_](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/second-treatise-of-government).

**David Foster Wallace Interviews**: I devoured David Foster Wallace’s interviews, trying to understand why he’s the voice for a generation. His writing is exceptional, but also sad, depressing, and at times, mopey. History will remember him as one of the most iconic authors of the late 20th century. [Start with this unedited interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGLzWdT7vGc), which is as revealing as it is awkward. Then, watch his [interview with Charlie Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GopJ1x7vK2Q). As you do, pay attention to his awareness of the moment and his obsession with what other people think of him.

**Kevin Kwok:** I first met Kevin in New York City. After two hours of conversation over a cocktail, I called a friend and said “I just got drinks with one of the smartest people I’ve ever met.” I can confirm that’s true. I [hosted Kevin on the podcast](https://perell.com/podcast/kevin-kwok) six months later, and now I’m a passionate consumer of his ideas. In particular, I recommend his essays on the [origins of populism](https://kwokchain.com/2018/10/02/populism/), and [this one about Rich Barton](https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/), the founder of Expedia, Zillow, and Glassdoor.

[**Fourth-World Country**](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/08/weirding-diary-7/)**:** Everybody is familiar with the ideas of first-world, second-world, and third-world countries, but this short article describes a model for a fourth-world country. It shines a light on the social and economic distress people now feel in first-world countries.

**Peter Turchin:** I can’t believe I just found this guy. I’ve only read one of his essays: [_Intra-Elite Competition: A Key Concept for Understanding the Dynamics of Complex Societies_](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/intra-elite-competition-a-key-concept-for-understanding-the-dynamics-of-complex-societies/)_._ Phenomenal.

[**How Long-Haul Trucking Works**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlPrAKtegFQ)**:** Supply chains impact all our lives, but they are mostly outside our field of view. Trucking moves the vast majority of the world’s freight, and 73% of America’s domestic freight. This video explains the economics of the industry, from driver salaries to truck stops on the highway. The video was made by an excellent channel called [Wendover Productions](https://www.youtube.com/user/Wendoverproductions). One of the commenters described it best: “Wendover is like a solar eclipse: He doesn’t come out often, but when he does it’s a treat.”

[**Age of Abundance**](https://redef.com/original/age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry)**:** This article deserves way more attention. It was first published in 2016 by Tal Shachar ([here’s my podcast with him](https://perell.com/podcast/tal-shachar)), and so much of it has come true. For years, I used Tal’s essays as a roadmap for how the future would unfold. He predicted it with stunning accuracy. This essay focuses on the shift from information scarcity to abundance, and how it will invert the media industry.

[**My Instagram**](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-36/essays/my-instagram/)**:** If you haven’t heard of [_n + 1_](https://nplusonemag.com/)magazine, it’s time to change that. Each of the long-form essays provides a window into modern culture with a writing style that reminds me of the [Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/). This Instagram essay tells the story of the author’s evolving relationship with the platform, and how the world around her became optimized for the Instagram aesthetic.

[**The Geopolitics of Oil**](https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/a-primer-on-the-geopolitics-of-oil/)**:** Word-for-worth, this is the best introduction to the oil industry I’ve found. Though the article is about oil, I particularly enjoyed learning about copper production, which is concentrated in only four countries: Chile, Peru, China, and the United States. Collectively, they produce more than half of the world’s copper. Relative to oil, it can be easily stockpiled. And every year, the United States consumes 1.8 million tons of it, one-third of which is imported.

**Awakening from the Meaning Crisis:** A thought-provoking [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54l8_ewcOlY&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ) where John Vervaeke explores why modern citizens are so desperate for meaning in their lives. His premise is that we are in the midst of a mental health crisis, highlighted by increases in anxiety, despair, and depression. [Here’s a 3-minute introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncd6q9uIEdw). If you’re just getting started, [here are some notes on the first episode](https://medium.com/@markmulvey/awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-by-john-vervaeke-ep-1-summary-notes-ccfb6a0ebf46).

[**Tradition is Smarter Than You Are**](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html)**:** As a general rule, the faster information flows, the less a society will value tradition, and today, information flows faster than ever. Our respect for the wisdom of our ancestors is further diminished by social media’s bias for the present, which I call the [Never-Ending Now](https://perell.com/blog/never-ending-now). But tradition is often a strategy for helping culture survive over long periods of time, even though the people within it are short-term oriented. [This article](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html) does a superb job of explaining the now-forgotten value of tradition.

**David Foster Wallace:** I’ve been whirling down the David Foster Wallace rabbit hole, and it’s showing no signs of stopping. At the big-picture level, I find his novels too sprawling and hard to follow. But his interviews are fantastic. To begin, I recommend [this book of five interviews](https://amzn.to/37tym8k) he conducted towards the end of his life and [this article](https://digboston.com/excerpt-the-writing-life-of-david-foster-wallace/) about his writing process (excerpted from a book called [_Process: The Writing Lives of Great Authors_](https://amzn.to/37wm6Ur)).

[**The Geopolitics of the United States**](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/geopolitics-united-states-part-1-inevitable-empire): A superb two-part series on America’s geography and how it shapes the country’s politics. The USA has a lot of structural advantages. For example, it has a big ocean on both sides of the country, the world’s largest contiguous piece of farmland, more major ports than the rest of the Western hemisphere, and more navigable internal waterways than the rest of the world combined.

[**In Praise of Idleness**](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/): A 1932 essay from Bertrand Russell where he talks about the cult of workaholism, and what we should do to avoid it. He talks about the problems with seeing hard work as inherently virtuous, and how our obsession with hard work leads to a concept for stillness. Here’s a [summary from Maria Popova](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/12/27/in-praise-of-idleness-bertrand-russell/).

[**Webster’s 1913 Dictionary**](https://www.websters1913.com/)**:** Write with a better dictionary. Modern dictionaries have lazy definitions that focus too much on simplicity at the cost of precision. Instead of using the default one on your computer, [bookmark this site](https://www.websters1913.com/), and start using the Webster’s 1913 dictionary. Alternatively, you can download it for your Kindle or computer [with this link](https://jonathanbuys.com/Setting_Up_Webster's_Dictionary/).

[**Netflix**](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/netflixbudget)**:** An 8-part essay series about Netflix from [Matthew Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/netflix), who is the best big media analyst I know. Every essay in the series covers a different aspect of how people misunderstand the company. Topics include the company’s content budget, their product & technology stack, how they think about scale, the paradox of the original series term, and how bond markets or cash losses will shape their future.

[**The Utopia of Rules**](https://amzn.to/2Cq1xMA): David Graeber is one of those authors who is often wrong, but always interesting. [In this interview](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/21/books-interview-david-graeber-the-utopia-of-rules), Graeber talks about how society has squeezed the eccentrics out of institutions, homogenized academia, and invented drugs to cope with bureaucracy’s tedious, all-consuming sprawl.

[**Alice Schroeder on Warren Buffett**](http://seekingalpha.com/article/235292-behind-the-scenes-with-buffett-s-biographer-alice-schroederv)**:** An illuminating interview with Warren Buffet’s biographer. I particularly enjoyed this quote: “He’s cautious and non-confrontational. He’s wary of extremes in all forms. He’s insistently reluctant to criticize anyone and hypersensitive to criticism himself. He needs to be liked and needs approval, but paradoxically is not a people-pleaser.” The best parts were about his relationships and hyper-awareness of risk.

****[**My Struggle**](https://amzn.to/3ggu49x)**:****** We’ll close with a couple of books. First, we’ll start with the first volume in a 6-part series by Karl Ove Knausgaard. I picked it up in San Francisco on the recommendation of two friends, who both rated it among the best memoirs they’ve ever read. I also enjoyed the [author’s interview with Tyler Cowen](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/karl-ove-knausgard/), who called him one of “the great writers of our civilization.” If you read nothing else, I recommend the first four pages about death. My goodness, they’re well-written. They’re anchored by this (now famous) opening string: “For the heart, life is simple: it beats for as long as it can. Then it stops.“

[**Definite Optimism as Human Capital**](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/)**:** This is one of my all-time favorite online essays. In it, Dan Wang makes the case that optimism is a goal worth striving for. He suggests we do that by gaining a greater appreciation for industry, extending the technological frontier, and the benefits of economic growth. Ideas from this essay are sprinkled throughout [my 15,000-word essay about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/blog/peter-thiel).

[**George Soros’ Theory**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCK265X/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)**:** One of the most successful investors of the 20th century laid out his Karl Popper inspired investment philosophy in a series of lectures about the [Open Society](https://www.philanthropydaily.com/george-soros-karl-popper-and-the-ironies-of-the-open-society/), reflexivity, capitalism, and the financial crisis.

**Bryson DeChambeau:** During my freshman year of high school, I played in a golf tournament in Fresno and watched Bryson his balls on the range next to me. I had never seen a golfer swing a club so smoothly. From the instant I saw him play, I knew he would turn pro. Today, he is the 7th ranked golfer in the world. He also hits the ball farther than any other golfer on the PGA Tour. Most impressive of all, he’s climbed up the world golf rankings with a tactful fitness regimen and on-course strategy. His rise to stardom is one of the most interesting stories in the sports world. For more, I recommend this [Golf Digest article](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/the-zealot-bryson-dechambeau), this [interview with his swing coach Chris Como](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aeTZTMSZcw), and [this interview about his off-season fitness regimen](https://youtu.be/_F1H0Td7pxs). People call him “The Golf Scientist.” Even if you aren’t a golfer, there’s a lot to learn from him. His rise should be a much bigger story.

[**Music and Burial in Human Evolution**](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/music-in-human-evolution/)**:** If you aren’t familiar with Kevin Simler’s writing, it’s time to change that. He writes at the intersection of anthropology, psychology, and evolution. His entire archive is worth reading but I recommend this essay on music in particular. Humans are the only ground-dwelling species that sings (the others like birds, gibbons, dolphins, whales, and seals sing from water or the air). Of all the animals that sing, humans are the only ones that use rhythm. This essay explores why.

[**Envy**](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2020/01/helmut-schoecks-envy.html)**:** A summary of Helmut Schoeck’s [_Envy_](https://amzn.to/2Xh9cEH)_,_ which was first published in 1966. The emotion comes from our animalistic, status-seeking nature, but it’s under-studied because it’s such a taboo emotion.

**Andrew Kortina:** One of my new favorite essayists. I recently read his article called [_Virtualization, Forklifts, Microphones, Shipping Containers, Video Conferencing, Stethoscopes_](https://kortina.nyc/essays/virtualization-forklifts-microphones-shipping-containers-video-conferencing-stethoscopes/)_._ In it, the author talks about the acceleration of certain kinds of technological adoption because COVID created winners and losers in the economy. When it comes to the intersection of technology, labor, and automation, Kortina is one of the best writers I know. [Here’s his full essay archive](https://kortina.nyc/). You might like his essay [_Social Systems are Computations that Minimize Uncertainty._](https://kortina.nyc/essays/social-systems-are-computations-that-minimize-uncertainty/)

[**Mark Zuckerberg Interview in 2005**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQWAVcyhsXc): “It’s essentially an online directory for students, where people can go and look up other people and find relevant information about them. Everything from what they’re interested in, to their contact information, what course they’re taking, who they know, who their friends are, what people say about them, and what photos they have now. It’s mostly a utility for people to figure out what’s going on in their lives and in their friends’ lives, for people they care about.”

[**My Life Pouring Concrete**](https://quillette.com/2020/08/02/my-life-pouring-concrete/)**:** One man’s haunting perspective on the construction industry, which he says is plagued by alcoholism and opioid addiction. This quote stuck out: “Most of the men I worked with had little formal education. Many had a criminal record. Men working in construction and extraction have the highest suicide rate of any industry, as well as the highest rate of opioid addiction and (predictably) overdoses. Alcoholism rates are second only to the mining industry.” [An excellent read, even if it’s a difficult one.](https://quillette.com/2020/08/02/my-life-pouring-concrete/)

**Plato’s Views on Education:** I read Book 7 of [_The Republic_](https://amzn.to/3fXZQ76)by Plato and wanted to dive deeper into his philosophy of education. At the childhood level, he believed in a free approach to learning. As he famously wrote: “Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion has no hold on the mind. Therefore, do not use compulsion, but let early education be rather a sort of amusement; this will better enable you to find out the natural bent of the child.” For a detailed summary, I [recommend this excellent Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ideas-of-Plato-on-education).

[**The Closing of the American Mind**](https://amzn.to/3iEb9mT)**:** This book is worth returning to, in part because it was one of the best-selling books in America in 1987. It remains as controversial today as it was when it was published. But the author Alan Bloom isn’t a shmuck. He wrote one of the canonical translations for [_The Republic_](https://amzn.to/3fXZQ76) ([free PDF here](https://mvlindsey.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/allen-bloom-the-republic.pdf)) and studied under Leo Strauss too. Since this was so popular, there are excellent analyses of it too. For a written one, I recommend this [praise-filled article in the _American Conservative_](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-american-mind-is-as-closed-as-ever/)or this [critique in _Rolling Stone_](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bloom-and-doom-the-closing-of-the-american-mind-85999/). Or, if you prefer audio, [here’s a one-hour summary](https://bradharris.com/the-closing-of-the-american-mind-by-allan-bloom/).

**Adam Curtis:** The creator of one of my favorite documentaries, [_The Century of the Self (full transcript here)_](http://aireform.com/wp-content/uploads/20160219cpy..-Century-of-the-Self-Transcript-4-part-film-series-by-A.Curtis-55p.pdf)_._ It’s about the intersection of psychology and consumerism and builds upon the ideas of Sigmund Freud (who shaped modern psychology) and Edward Bernays (who founded public relations). As a member of the BBC staff in the 1980s and 90s, he’s created a bunch of other documentaries too.

[**David McCollough Interview**](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/894/the-art-of-biography-no-2-david-mccullough)**:** One of my all-time favorite interviews with one of the great American biographers. My father read his book about the [Wright Brothers](https://amzn.to/3l8fBwk) and said it was superb. The Pulitzer Prize award winner has also written books about [John Adams](https://amzn.to/3aJQ9s6), [Harry Truman](https://amzn.to/31iEo8R), and [The Brooklyn Bridge](https://amzn.to/31h7pSh). Not a single one of his books has ever gone out of print. I actually haven’t read any of them yet, so [I can only recommend this excellent interview](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/894/the-art-of-biography-no-2-david-mccullough).

**Robert Kurson:** Woah. His books are non-fiction narratives at their best. [_Rocket Men_](https://amzn.to/2Yo5UzV) is an excellent recounting of the Apollo 8 space mission where three astronauts flew around the moon. I was reading snippets from the book and enjoyed them so much that I immediately purchased another book of his: [_Shadow Divers_](https://amzn.to/2CLr2Zk)_._

**Post Office:** Aaron Gordon wrote a [newsletter about the New York City subway system](https://signalproblems.substack.com/archive). After, he created [a newsletter about the United States Postal Service](https://themail.substack.com/). Gordon is at his best when he writes about bureaucracy, incentives, and organizational management. He nailed it with the subway system and to date, I haven’t found anybody who writes about those topics better. If you want to read about the NY subway system, [I recommend this article about “The Subway Action Plan.”](https://signalproblems.substack.com/p/the-subway-action-plan-is-not-whats)

[**Academy of Ideas**](https://academyofideas.com/)**:** A series of short podcasts and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/academyofideas), with transcripts of every episode to make note-taking easy. In particular, I enjoyed this one about [Modern Art and the Decline of Civilization](https://academyofideas.com/2019/06/modern-art-decline-of-civilization/), which builds upon Nietzche’s [_Will to Power_](https://amzn.to/3ggSFar)and Nikolai Berdyaev’s [_The Meaning of History_](https://amzn.to/2Eml9Co)_,_ which looks like an excellent book. I’ll remember Carl Jung’s quote that art is “the unwitting mouthpiece of the psychic secrets of [the] times.” Through their creations, artists give form to the underlying psychology of their culture.

**Christianity:** Studying Christianity is one of the best ways to understand the West. I can’t believe I just discovered [Peter Kreeft](http://www.peterkreeft.com/featured-writing.htm). His website has in-depth articles about evidence for the [resurrection of Christ](http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/resurrection-evidence.htm) and the [uniqueness of Christianity](http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/christianity-uniqueness.htm). The friend who introduced me to Peter’s work is a Rene Girard scholar and he recommended [this introduction to Christianity](https://amzn.to/3hDRVO3) as the best book-length treatment of the subject.

**Elena Shalneva:** We need a word for the sadness you feel after you’ve read everything an author’s ever published, and there’s nothing new left to explore. That’s exactly how I feel about Elena’s work. Start with this essay [In Defence of the Humanities](https://quillette.com/2020/07/14/in-defence-of-the-humanities/) or this one about [work as the tragedy of our age](https://quillette.com/2020/01/30/work-the-tragedy-of-our-age/).

****[**Land of the Free**](http://im1776.com/2021/02/12/land-of-the-free/)**:** I love articles like this: sharp, witty, and fearless. Vibrant rhetoric inevitably follows from such a spiky point of view too. You’ll leave feeling a little dizzy, having passionately agreed or disagreed with so many of the author’s points. But you sure as hell won’t feel indifferent, and that’s what good writing is all about, eh?

[**Why the West Needs Plato**](https://engelsbergideas.com/essays/leadership-in-crisis-why-the-west-needs-plato-more-than-ever/)**:** A good overview of Plato’s philosophy of government. He was skeptical of too much democracy, so he wanted society to be run by guardians who focused on long-term prosperity and weren’t influenced by the winds of culture. Too much democracy, he said, would give way to anarchy and tyranny.

[**Julian Lehr**](https://julian.digital/2020/09/04/a-meta-layer-for-notes/)**:** One of the Internet’s best up-and-coming writers. [This essay](https://julian.digital/2020/09/04/a-meta-layer-for-notes/) is a critique of note-taking apps, inspired by Basecamp’s new Hey email product. He argues that the current paradigm of note-taking apps such as Evernote and Notion suffer from being stand-alone apps. Note-taking should be more spacial and should work more like an operating system for your life. Right now, there is too much context switching between apps.

[**An Introduction to the Kelly Criterion**](https://nickyoder.com/kelly-criterion/)**:** A formula that calculates what percentage of your net worth you should wage in order to maximize your expected wealth increase. This quote explains why the formula is important: “A trader with mediocre strategy and a great risk model will become fairly successful. A trader with a great strategy and a mediocre risk model will become bankrupt.” I also enjoyed this one from Ed Seykota: “There are old traders, and there are bold traders. There are very few old, bold traders.” But the most interesting part of the article was learning that traders shouldn’t actually bet on the Kelly-optimal formula because the real world rarely has known probabilities and payoffs.

**Athletes Don’t Down Their Tattoos:** Here’s an interesting question: Should athletes own the tattoos on their bodies? Some legal experts say that tattoos are technically owned by the tattoo artist, not the person with the actual tattoos. Some artists are suing video games that display their tattoos, such as the ones on LeBron James’ body. To avoid the commotion, some professional athletes now sign contracts with artists before the needle goes into their body. [Here’s a short introduction](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/12/athletes-dont-tattoos.html).

**Ted Polhemus:** An under-rated fashion theorist who writes about the sociology of the body and how we communicate with style. In particular, I recommend his articles on the relationship between [appearance and identity](http://www.tedpolhemus.com/main_concept2%20467.html) and why [body decoration makes us human](http://www.tedpolhemus.com/main_concept4%20467.html). If you’re feeling ambitious, he wrote a short book in 1978 called [_Fashion & Anti-Fashion_](https://amzn.to/33BjYIe)_._

**WEIRD Societies:** Joseph Henrich is one of my favorite academics (here’s [my podcast interview](https://perell.com/podcast/joe-henrich-what-makes-society-smart) with him). I found him through his excellent book, _The Secret of Our Success_. More recently, he’s been studying WEIRD societies (the acronym stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). For more, I [recommend his talk at UBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6e_5x4LQz8), his [2010 paper on WEIRD societies](http://hci.ucsd.edu/102b/readings/WeirdestPeople.pdf), or this article about the [Church’s influence on Western kinship](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6466/eaau5141?ck_subscriber_id=344074356).

[**It’s Charisma, Stupid**](http://www.paulgraham.com/charisma.html): An old article from Paul Graham, where he argues that the more charismatic candidate has won every election since 1964. Why? Television, which rewarded a different kind of presidential candidate. He cites an exception from the 1968 election but says it actually proves the rule because television debates were still evolving. Here’s a relevant data point from my [What the Hell is Going On essay](https://perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on): “During the U.S. presidential election in 1968, the average soundbite—that is, any footage of a candidate speaking uninterrupted—was still a little more than 40 seconds, but that had fallen to less than 10 seconds at the end of the 80s and 7.8 seconds in 2000.”

[**Oxford Very Short Introductions**](https://amzn.to/3j5jUHk): I worked through the founding articles of the United States and starting with this book about [the Constitution](https://amzn.to/2G9ExU2). It’s part of this excellent series of introductory books from Oxford. If you read nothing else but these books for three years, you’d be the smartest polymath in your entire social group. It’s not that exciting, but it’s an excellent learning strategy.

[**McLuhan Galaxy**](https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/)**:** Marshall McLuhan is one of my all-time favorite writers, but he’s notoriously hard to read. Luckily, the folks at McLuhan Galaxy curate his ideas and put them into readable prose. Understanding his ideas is table stakes for understanding how the Internet is changing the world. But instead of reading his books, [start with this website](https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/).

[**Why Be Jewish?**](https://amzn.to/30sTw2W)**:** I read this short book to prepare for my [interview with Rabbi David Wolpe](https://perell.com/podcast/rabbi-david-wolpe-jewish-wisdom). It’s written for people considering a return to the faith or people who are drawn to conversion, but it doubles as an [introduction to Jewish values](https://amzn.to/30sTw2W) for anybody interested in the subject. For a more secular treatment of the same idea, I recommend [Oxford’s short introduction to Judaism](https://amzn.to/34iDV74).

[**Michael Nielsen’s Quotes Page**](https://mnielsen.github.io/notes/quotes/quotes.html)**:** This page is so good that it makes me jealous that I don’t have something similar. Michael Nielsen ([who I interviewed here](https://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen)) compiled his favorite quotes from people like Richard Feynman, Brian Eno, and Susan Sontag. Oh, and by the way, if you haven’t heard of Michael, it’s time to change that. Start with this essay about [developing transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

[**Oswald Spengler**](https://engelsbergideas.com/portraits/oswald-spengler-an-intellectual-life/)**:** One of the most under-rated philosophers out there. As an early 20th century writer, his work is a blend of Joseph Campbell, Martin Heidegger, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. His most famous book is called _The Decline of the West,_ which hints at his pessimism about the future of civilization. For an introduction, I [recommend this short article](https://engelsbergideas.com/portraits/oswald-spengler-an-intellectual-life/) or [John David Ebert’s lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCdi10nRhEw).

[**In Praise of the Gods**](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-the-gods)**:** A soul-filled essay from Simon Sarris, where he critiques rationality as one of our most powerful tools, but also one of our worst excesses. The essay is an argument for post-rational wisdom and a more intuitive orientation towards the world. This is a masterpiece.

[**Lee Kuan Yew Speech**](https://youtu.be/00KNtqv2gyQ)**:** Lee Kuan Yew served as the Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959 – 1990, and this is my favorite speech of his. It conveys a seriousness that the American government should learn from. This is my favorite quote: “I ignore polling as a method of government. I think that shows a certain weakness of mind, an inability to chart a course. Whichever way the wind blows. Whichever way the media encourages the people to go, you follow. You’re not a leader.”

**Andrey Miroshnichenko:** I’m going to do something I rarely do and share a book I haven’t read. But this one is worth it. Miroshnichenko wrote one of my favorite books of all time: [_Human as Media_](https://amzn.to/2GGIYq3)_._ He’s a criminally under-rated media theorist, and on Tuesday, he messaged me to tell me about the launch of his new book: [_Postjournalism and the Death of Newspapers_](https://amzn.to/3lsczCo)_._

[**Preference Falsification**](http://www.brucesabin.com/private_truths_public_lies.html)**:** One of my favorite ideas from Timur Kuran. It comes from a book called [_Public Truths, Private Lies_](https://amzn.to/31dLE5G)(here’s a [written summary](http://www.brucesabin.com/private_truths_public_lies.html) and [a podcast about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzjqjU2FOwA)), where Kuran shows how people lie about their beliefs to look good in social situations. As Martin Luther King once said: “Many people fear nothing more terribly than to take a position which stands out sharply and clearly from the prevailing opinion. The tendency of most is to adopt a view that is so ambiguous that it will include everything and so popular that it will include everybody. Not a few men who cherish lofty and noble ideas hide them under a bushel for fear of being called different.” Once you learn about preference falsification, you’ll start seeing it everywhere. For more ideas like this, [here’s a list of 50 that shaped my worldview](https://perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life).

[**Mimetic Traps**](https://briantimar.github.io/notes/mimetic/mimetic)**:** This article belongs in the “everybody should read this category.” The author reflects on his experience in academia, where he was so focused on imitating his peers and pursuing competition that he ended up wasting his time on meaningless work.

[**Reflections on Asperger’s Syndrome**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/04/03/why-shades-of-aspergers-syndrome-are-the-secret-to-building-a-great-tech-company/)**:** [Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/blog/peter-thiel) has long condemned the modern world for making it so difficult for people to follow-through on original ideas that founders with Asperger’s account for the lion’s share of successful startups. Too strong a dose can obviously be crippling. People with Asperger’s are unemployed at rates that far exceed the general population. But a smaller dose may increase the chances of making a breakthrough innovation.

[**The Sabbath**](https://amzn.to/3lTfILQ)**:** Rabbi David Wolpe strongly recommended this little book when I [interviewed him](https://perell.com/podcast/rabbi-david-wolpe-jewish-wisdom). It’s 100 pages, so you can read it all in one sitting. The writing is exquisite too. The author argues that we need the Sabbath to honor time because we spend the rest of our lives honoring space. We work in service of the grand, the concrete, and the magnificent, but only with the Sabbath do we honor the majesty of time.

[**Loneliness and Totalitarianism**](https://aeon.co/essays/for-hannah-arendt-totalitarianism-is-rooted-in-loneliness)**:** Hannah Arendt is famous for her 1951 book, [_The Origins of Totalitarianism_](https://amzn.to/34qqP9b)_,_ and this summary of her thoughts on loneliness as it pertains to totalitarianism is superb. In particular, I resonated with her distinction between loneliness and the state of simply being alone.

[**The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry**](https://amzn.to/2TlD5RO)**:** I have such a love-hate relationship with this book. I can’t stand the writing. It’s written like an ultra-conversational blog post, which makes it hard to take it seriously. But some parts of the book are fantastic. It’s written by a Portland-based Christian pastor who makes a strong case for taking a weekly Sabbath and re-thinking our relationship with time. With that said, the people in my book club _loved_ the book. One guy has already read it three times this year.

**Fallibalism:** I discovered this idea in [_The Beginning of Infinity_](https://amzn.to/32CT4A7) by David Deutsch. It outlines a philosophy of constant learning and a consistent march towards truth. In addition to correcting your past mistakes, you aim to question the assumptions that everybody takes for granted. Or, as the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy [defines it](https://iep.utm.edu/fallibil/): “Fallibilism is the epistemological thesis that no belief can ever be rationally supported or justified in a conclusive way. Always, there remains a possible doubt as to the truth of the belief.” To begin, I [recommend this quote from Deutsch](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1326016276964241408).

**Pirsig’s Metaphysics of Quality:** Robert Pirsig is famous for a book called [_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_](https://amzn.to/3eXWy53). It’s an excellent book that has almost nothing to do with motorcycles. But instead of recommending the entire book, I’ll point you to his metaphysics of quality. In the book, he tries to define quality even though it precedes any intellectual description of it. Like beauty, it exists as a perceptual experience that words cannot describe. Start with the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_metaphysics_of_Quality) or [this _Philosophy Now_ explainer](https://philosophynow.org/issues/122/Robert_Pirsig_and_His_Metaphysics_of_Quality).

**Elite Overproduction:** Peter Turchin is one of America’s fastest up-and-coming social thinkers. He presents a grim picture of America’s future in his book, [_Ages of Discord_](https://amzn.to/32YN6tF)_._ Specifically, he blames “elite overproduction” for many of America’s challenges and argues that there’s a surplus of smart young Americans fighting for admission to elite colleges and graduates fighting for the same job slots. All that competition, he says, causes society to fracture and is one of the chief causes of political instability. In both cases, the number of people fighting for admission is rising much faster than the number of available slots. That’s partially why schooling and urban housing prices are rising so fast. For an explainer, I recommend [this _Atlantic_ article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/) or this [explainer from Bloomberg’s Noah Smith](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-06/the-rich-and-privileged-can-revolt-too).

**The Enlightenment:** I’ve been studying the Enlightenment. [The Wikipedia page is superb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) and introduced me to people like Cesare Beccaria, who condemned torture and the death penalty to become one of the founding thinkers in the field of criminology. Inspired in part by the article, I read [_The New Atlantis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantis) by Francis Bacon. For a different perspective on the Enlightenment, I recommend Johnathan Bi’s [masterful summary of _Dialectic of the Enlightenment_](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/the-dialectic-of-enlightenment), which is one of the most important works of philosophy to come out of the Frankfurt School.

**Arthur Chandler:** There are few things I enjoy more than finding an ugly website with excellent information. It makes the information feel like a secret. Arthur Chandler is a professor at San Francisco State University. Though I recommend playing around on his website, you should start with this article on [Oswald Spengler’s morphology](http://www.arthurchandler.com/spengler-morphology) or this one about [Plato’s Cave](http://www.arthurchandler.com/platos-cave). You’ll also find ideas about style, mathematics, dance, photography, and technology.

**Münchhausen Trilemma:** This idea comes from the world of epistemology. It shows the impossibility of proving any truth, even in the fields of logic and mathematics. Whenever somebody asks for further proof on an argument, there are only three places the speaker can fall back on: (1) the circular argument, in which the proof of some proposition is supported only by that proposition, (2) the regressive argument, where each argument requires further proof, and (3) the dogmatic argument, which rests on accepted principles which are merely asserted rather than defended. [Those definitions are from Wikipedia, which provides an excellent introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma).

[**Peter Thiel and Garry Kasparov**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOvEPYNEsc)**:** I’ve [written extensively about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/blog/peter-thiel), and this is one of his [most insightful videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOvEPYNEsc). In it, he speaks with chess champion Garry Kasparov about technology, chess, human rights, and the future of the global economy. I wish there were more videos like this of two smart people hanging out and having a casual conversation, beyond the standard interview format. For a preview of the full video, I [recommend this six-minute clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IjNd5RpN4Y).

[**Century of the Self**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPmg0R1M04)**:** A 2013 documentary about how people in power have used Sigmund Freud’s theories to control and manipulate crowds. It discusses the relationship between Freud and Edward Bernays, who was Freud’s nephew and the founder of the public relations industry. If you’re interested in advertising, narrative control, and crowd psychology, you will love this documentary. Oh, and [here’s the full transcript](http://pialogue.info/books/Century-of-the-Self.php).

**Zena Hitz:** Hitz is a tutor at St. John’s College, which is famous for its Great Books program, and the author of one of my favorite recently published books called [_Lost in Thought: The Hidden Pleasures of an Intellectual Life_](https://amzn.to/33jlAqI)_._ Instead of diving straight into the book, I recommend her [interview with Russ Roberts](https://www.econtalk.org/zena-hitz-on-lost-in-thought/) or her essay called [_Freedom and the Intellectual Life_](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2016/04/freedom-and-intellectual-life)_._ If you really want to fall down the rabbit hole, [she collected all her work here](https://zenahitz.net/).

[**The Intellectual Life of the British Working Class**](https://amzn.to/3q5FHT2)**:** Hitz turned me onto this 550-page book. When we think of the classics, we usually think of academics and aristocrats. But this book shows how erudite the British working classes have historically been with stories about their passion for classic literature and philosophy. The book goes into more depth than I’d like, so I recommend either [this review](https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/the-intellectual-life-british-working-classes-jonathan-rose/) or [this one.](http://freerangereading.blogspot.com/2015/01/review-intellectual-life-of-british.html)

**[Naval Ravikant Interviews Nassim Taleb](http://www.mrsideproject.com/2018/11/15/nassim-taleb-naval-ravikant-blockcon-2018/):** I’ve learned more from Nassim Taleb than just about anybody. His concepts are simple and timeless. Taleb draws from finance, philosophy, and statistics and wraps them together into his own, unique worldview. This interview is one of the best summaries I’ve seen of Taleb’s ideas. If you prefer to read an essay, I recommend [this article](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-the-fourth-quadrant-a-map-of-the-limits-of-statistics) and [this article.](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility) Both excellent.

**[Capitalism and Schizophrenia](https://genius.com/Jonah-peretti-capitalism-and-schizophrenia-annotated):** This is the best rabbit hole I’ve been down in a while. In the essay, Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed laid out the theory behind his company years before he started it. His essay builds upon the work of Fredric Jameson, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari to present a new perspective on the relationship between identity and capitalism. The best explanation of Peretti’s essay comes from a [YouTube channel called Cuck Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9srhgHzUFd4). I also recommend this [background article from Vox.](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5730762/buzzfeeds-founder-used-to-write-marxist-theory-and-it-explains)

**[Reinventing Explanation](http://michaelnielsen.org/reinventing_explanation/index.html):** We forget how tools shape our thought. This essay explores how new media transforms thought and improves our understanding of the world. Through media, we can think the unthinkable. Consider a subway map. It’s a brilliant invention precisely because it distorts reality, but by distorting reality, maps that aren’t drawn to scale influence property values, business decisions, and transportation flows. [Here’s my interview with Michael Nielsen, the author.](http://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen)

****[**Economics as a Moral Philosophy**](https://www.presentwitness.com/economics-as-a-moral-philosophy)**:** I‘ve always been annoyed with the idea that economics is a complete science. It isn’t. Humans are too unpredictable and the ideas break down too often. But in particular, everybody should know the basics of microeconomics. Though this article doubles as a critique of the discipline, I like the idea that economics is a value system that shapes our decision-making in ways that are so ingrained in society that they’re invisible to us.

[**Rethinking Economics**](https://amzn.to/2wZA8il)**:** I’m torn about the value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a metric. On one hand, it’s highly correlated with happiness indices, and people like [Tyler Cowen](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2019/01/09/tyler-cowen/case-longer-term) have gracefully argued that we should pursue a strategy of maximizing sustainable GDP with a low discount rate in the future. With that said, the headstrong pursuit of GDP has perverse side effects for physical and emotional health. In the past 100 years, in America, we’ve seen the [decline of community](https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling), the [death of the nuclear family](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/), and a country that is increasingly obese and diabetic.

# Business & Tech

****[**Interview with Patrick Collison**](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-patrick-collison-co-founder)**:** Of all the Silicon Valley CEOs, Patrick is the one I admire most. This interview is a whirlwind through his interests: biology, online business, technological progress, aviation, funding scientific research, energy, and culture. I don’t remember the last time I learned about so many new ideas in one sitting. Such a fun read.

**Leaked Technology Emails:** One of my friends made an [astute observation](https://twitter.com/jeremygiffon/status/1408111798679650312?s=20) on Twitter: “The only business writing worth reading are leaked emails. Writing that was never meant to be a product is always closer to the truth.” Amen, brother. With that in mind, I’ve been enjoying [this Twitter account of leaked technology emails](https://twitter.com/TechEmails) (there’s a [Substack](https://techemails.substack.com/welcome) too). For starters, I liked [Steve Jobs’ executive team meeting agenda](https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400208754659008519?s=20) from 2007 and [this email he sent to the CEO of Adobe in 2005](https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1407016788240576512?s=20).

****[**Process Knowledge**](https://future.a16z.com/the-silicon-in-silicon-valley-again/)**:** The author Dan Wang is one of those essayists who continually inspires me to level up my craft. He’s one of the most learned people I know. One time, he spent an hour breaking down the structure of Chinese politics for me and some friends. It was so well done that if it had been public, it would have been a viral YouTube video. Anyways, this essay laments the decline of America’s manufacturing base. Specifically, through the lens of process knowledge which he defines as earned experience that can’t be written down. Beyond that, he paints a vision for Silicon Valley as a place where people give hardware manufacturing the respect it deserves.

****[**The Story of TikTok**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbnDay35L8I)**:** A conversation with two of the savviest product analysts I know: [Eugene Wei](https://perell.com/podcast/eugene/) and [Kevin Kwok](https://perell.com/podcast/kevin-kwok/). Both are previous podcast guests and Eugene has written three long-form essays about TikTok ([this is my favorite one](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat)). If you’re interested in online creativity, Silicon Valley-style product building, and how social media is transforming, you’ll enjoy this 90-minute conversation.

[**Working Backwards**](https://amzn.to/3uOhqCC)**:** I’ve long been obsessed with Amazon’s business operations practices, and [besides this essay from Zack Kanter](https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/), this book is the best thing I’ve seen written about them. The two authors worked directly with Bezos, so [the book](https://amzn.to/3uOhqCC) is filled with one-liners like this: “Good intentions don’t work. Mechanisms do.” Long-term, you can’t solve problems by working more or trying harder. If you want persistent change, you have to fix the underlying system.

**The Master Switch:** As Hollywood continues to lose influence, I want to explore the history of it so I can make sense of where the culture industry is going. [_The Master Switch_](https://amzn.to/3aOoJT1) is my favorite book on this subject, and it’s time for a re-read. The writing is dry but the ideas are excellent. The thesis is that information industries are defined by a cycle between periods of closed and open, centralization and decentralization. But it’s really a series of histories about information technologies like radio, television, and the movie industry. [Here’s a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVZLl4EKQis) the author gave about the book.

**Debt:** You know me: I‘m always looking for radically independent thinkers who can shake my worldview. This week’s nominee is David Graeber. I bring him up today because my closest childhood friend, [Zander Nethercutt just wrote an essay](https://zander.substack.com/p/the-venmo-generation-is-over-the) about his seminal book_:_ [_Debt_](https://amzn.to/3tJBd53)_._ Start there. Then, if Zander’s piece moves you to learn more about the book, I recommend this [summary from Alex Danco](https://alexdanco.com/2020/05/15/debt-the-first-5000-years/) or this one from a blog called [_Understanding Society_](https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2011/11/david-graebers-reflections-on-money.html)_._

**Marshall McLuhan:** This newsletter only has one rule: You must be somewhat familiar with McLuhan’s ideas. They’re too important to ignore, and unlike most intellectuals, he’s a blast to listen to. He was a media theorist who did most of his work in the 60s and 70s. With that in mind, here’s my starter guide. If you want to read something, start with [_The Medium is the Massage_](https://amzn.to/3oz2rdS) or [_McLuhan Misunderstood_](https://amzn.to/3fFiNxD)_._ If you prefer to listen, you’ll like [this explainer from Terrance McKenna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aljs5vlW2u4) or my conversation with his grandson (_Listen on_ [_iTunes_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-massage-presented-by-the-mcluhan-institute/id1524357056) _or_ [_Spotify_](https://open.spotify.com/show/0TFoBS1vBUnvZ2tZrd6g68)).

**Things to Hang on Your Mental Mug Tree**: When I study business, I look for authors who are also practitioners because their theories are filtered through the lens of experience. Rory Sutherland tops the list. I [interviewed him last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbdFn9UyDY) and [summarized his ideas in an article too](https://perell.com/note/rory-sutherland/). I discovered his work in this top-notch interview, which is an [excellent introduction to his ideas](https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-things-to-hang-on-your-mental-mug-tree).

****[**CodeMiko**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsQjxEd-gsw&t=2s)**:** Here’s a weird trip to the future. This video is about a professional Twitch streamer who has created a pseudonymous world for herself. She used Unreal Engine and the kind of motion capture suit they use to make video games to create a character for herself. One of the YouTube comments nailed it: Today, we live in a world where humans pretend to be digital avatars, but in the future, digital avatars will pretend to be human.

****[**How McDonald’s Really Makes Money**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVj3vp-lho)**:** The first YouTube comment summarizes this video better than I ever could: “Burger is their side business, charging rent is their cash cow.” In fact, with $39 billion in assets, McDonald’s is the 5th largest real estate company in the world.

[**A Legendary Interview**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuvrZFJLXSk)**:** The YouTube algorithm usually does an outstanding job of recommending conversations with brilliant people in the public eye. But every now and then, there’s a glitch in the system. [This conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuvrZFJLXSk) with Mark Zuckerberg, Patrick Collison, and Tyler Cowen deserves more than 8,000 views. Thanks to [Blake Robbins](https://twitter.com/blakeir/status/1362497110504046593) for the pointer.

****[**Amazon Logistics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qanMpnYsjk)**:** It’s official. I’m obsessed with video essays on YouTube, and it’s not going to stop. This video from Wendover Productions is a tour through Amazon’s mind-bogglingly complex logistics system. My favorite part was seeing how the incentives of Amazon, as compared to UPS and FedEx, influence their flight routes.

[**The Story of Uniqlo**](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/uniqlo-fast-retailing-ceo-tadashi-yanai-management-principles): The CEO of Uniqlo shares his principles for the soul of his company. Maybe I like the article because Uniqlo is one of my favorite brands, but it doubles as a window into the kind of Japanese craftsmanship I learned about in my [podcast episode with Patrick McKenzie](https://perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous/). For years, Uniqlo was seen as an undesirable brand. But that changed with the 1998 launch of a flagship store in Tokyo’s Harajuku neighborhood, and today Uniqlo is a global brand with ~$16 billion in yearly sales.

**Vitalik Buterin:** Vitalik is the founder of Ethereum and in my opinion, one of the smartest people alive today. In [this Annual Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html), he talks about the changing role of economics in a digital world. The traditional models of economics don’t apply in the virtual world, where copying is cheap, few things are “consumable,” and goods are non-rivalrous. I also recommend his interviews with [Tyler Cowen](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/vitalik-buterin-tyler-cowen-cryptocurrency-blockchain-tech-3a2b20c12c97) and [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TwNNgiNZ7Y). If his ideas catch your attention, I also recommend the [articles on his website](https://vitalik.ca/).

**[Jason Garrett speaks about Jason Witten](https://twitter.com/nfl/status/994672634066436096?s=12):** The first time I watched this video, it moved me to tears. In four minutes, Garrett highlights the beauty of football, teamwork, and leadership.

**[Build a Team That Ships](https://startupboy.com/2012/04/27/build-a-team-that-ships/):** Keep the team small. All doers, not talkers. Absolutely no middle managers, People choose what to work on. No tasks longer than one week. One person per project. If they can’t ship, release them. It’s not perfect. But we ship. 

**[Great Founder Theory](http://samoburja.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Great-Founder-Theory-v-1.43.pdf):** Samo Burja is one of the smartest people you’ve never heard of. His ideas are as exceptional as they are unknown. He’s been researching the causes of societal decay and flourishing. Known for his Great Founder Theory, Samo says that as the landscape of founders and institutions changes, so does the landscape of society. If you’re looking for a lighter introduction, I recommend [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@samo.burja/great-founder-theory-93751e25c173) or [my interview with Samo.](http://perell.com/podcast/samo-burja)

**[Ads Don’t Work that Way](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/):** This article will re-shape the way you think about advertising. It’s the best explanation I’ve seen for why brands spend millions on Super Bowl ads and why companies like Nike and Apple are so powerful. Brand advertising works because it creates common knowledge. It’s also an introduction to an under-rated concept: common knowledge. For a fact to be common knowledge among a group, it’s not enough for everyone to know it. Everyone must also know that everyone else knows it — and know that they know that they know it… and so on. 

**[Marshall McLuhan Interview](https://www.nextnature.net/2009/12/the-playboy-interview-marshall-mcluhan/):** [_Understanding Media_](https://amzn.to/2nR9Bz4) by Marshall McLuhan has shaped my thinking more than any other book. Writing in the 1960s, McLuhan was 50 years ahead of his time. He’s the ultimate internet philosopher. According to one writer: “McLuhan’s theories are subtle and powerful. In fact, it is hard for me to imagine anyone being able to navigate the contemporary environment without at least a good grasp of his principles.” This is the best text-based introduction to Marshall McLuhan’s ideas. I also recommend his interviews on YouTube. 

**[Rory Sutherland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUeJoS3cTu8&t=11s):** Rory Sutherland is a rare intellectual whose ideas are better consumed in video than in print. Combining economics, psychology and technology, Sutherland discusses how we can improve the human experience by changing our environment. With wit and humor, Sutherland will open your eyes to the power of behavioral economics and the quirks of human decision making. If you prefer to read, I recommend [this article](https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-things-to-hang-on-your-mental-mug-tree).

**[Understanding the Blue Church](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5):** An exploration of how shifts in media are changing the kinds of narratives that flow through society. For the entire post World War II era, narratives were controlled by the mass media. Now that’s changing. Inspired by the work of Marshall McLuhan, the author proposes terms to help us navigate the 21st century media landscape. I also recommend [Paul Graham’s essay](http://paulgraham.com/re.html) on why the world is fragmenting.

**[The Age of Abundance](https://redef.com/original/age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry):** The media business is fracturing and everybody knows it. We’re moving from a world of information scarcity to a world of information abundance. As a result, the media industry is inverting. I also recommend the following articles about the [future of marketing](https://redef.com/original/light-at-the-end-of-the-funnel-why-the-marketing-revolution-is-about-to-arrive), the [future of television](https://redef.com/original/after-tv-videos-future-will-be-bigger-more-diverse-precarious-than-its-past), the [future of live entertainment](https://redef.com/original/the-death-and-resurrection-of-live-communal-entertainment), and [the future of video](https://redef.com/original/presentation-redef-on-the-future-of-video). Collectively, these articles by Tal Shachar and Matthew Ball are the best articles I’ve seen about the future of media.

**[Just Keep Buying](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/just-keep-buying-7d31402231c9%20):** Investing is like a snowball rolling down a hill. Just keep buying and watch that ball grow. When you sell out, you’re selling out future wealth. Ride the highs, weather the lows, and hold onto your assets as you acquire more. Just keep buying. 

**[The Freakishly Strong Base](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-freakishly-strong-base/):** Warren Buffett’s fortune isn’t due to just being a good investor, but being a good investor since he was literally a child. $80.7 billion of Warren Buffett’s $81 billion net worth was accumulated after his 50th birthday. Seventy-eight billion of the $81 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s. Start investing as young as you can. Encourage young people to do the same. Build a reputation through small, consistent acts. That’s where everything huge begins. [You might also enjoy my interview with Morgan Housel, the author.](https://perell.com/podcast/morgan-housel-writing-for-the-internet/)

**[Welcome to Air Space](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification):** From bars, to coffee shops, to startup offices, the internet is transforming the real-world. In this essay, [Kyle Chayka](http://perell.com/podcast/kyle-chayka) asks: “is the contemporary city like the contemporary airport — all the same?” The essay is cynical, yet thought-provoking. Chayka argues that the internet has created a soul-dissipating uniformity and a globalized sameness-as-a-service. By disconnecting from its geography and making everything as average as possible, AirSpace is the antithesis of travel.

**[How Steve Kerr Leads Stephen Curry](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1005862520987570176):** This is leadership at its finest. In this short video, Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, speaks to Stephen Curry, his star player. With each word, he dishes respect and inspires confidence. If you’re interested in Steve Kerr, he has a [fascinating backstory](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/sports/basketball/steve-kerr-golden-state-warriors.html).

**[The Algorithmic Trap](http://perell.com/blog/the-algorithmic-trap):** Algorithms trick us into thinking we’re getting real and authentic experiences, when in fact, we’re getting the opposite. Algorithms are great at giving you something you like, but terrible at giving you something you love. Worse, by promoting familiarity, algorithms punish culture. The more I travel, the less I depend on algorithms. Especially in cities, I find myself shifting adding friction back to my travel experience — shifting away from digital recommendations and back towards human ones. 

**[Understanding Abundance](https://medium.com/social-capital/understanding-abundance-introduction-346dcc5280dd) and [Emergent Layers](https://medium.com/@alexdanco/emergent-layers-an-introduction-f91c3cbe0175):** These four-part series are devoted to a single question: What happens when friction goes away? As a general rule, technology makes scarce things abundant. But a new scarcity always emerges. By focusing on industry structures and competitive behavior at large, this series outlines the shift from scarcity to abundance to scarcity.

**[You and Your Research](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html):** This is a long speech by Richard Hamming, a Bell Labs computer pioneer. He says that knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity — it is very much like compound interest.

**[How I Stay Productive](https://t.co/nrB4uAgXUr):** Nat Eliason is a good friend and one of the most productive people I know. In this article, he lays out his system for productivity with detail and diligence. I guarantee you’ll find something in here to implement. 

**[Growth Without Goals](http://investorfieldguide.com/growth-without-goals/):** Most productivity advice focuses on the importance of goals. Goals, though, can be constraining. This article offers an alternative. In a world where maximizing serendipity is increasingly important, rigid goals can blind us to unexpected opportunities. Rather than focusing on goals, we can build a set of daily practices and strive for continual, habitual practices instead of achievement-based success.

[**Apple Advertisement**](https://twitter.com/biwills/status/1220546504345014272?s=20)**:** Apple published a new 1-minute advertisement geared towards future employees, and it’s exceptional. Simple, elegant, colorful. Classic Apple. My suggestion is to watch it twice, once with sound and once without it.

[**PliimPRO**](https://pliim.app/): This app lets you safely share your screen. With a single click, you can hide desktop icons, pause notifications, and clean your computer. Then, after you’re done presenting, you can unclick the button and return to your computer as normal.

[**Tech Subpoenaed PDFs**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i8i3wc8w9pukvbk/AADCTOgh-Ijy8ZbihXRRrjQsa?dl=0): Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google testified in front of Congress and were forced to share some fascinating presentations, emails, and chat logs. They have been deleted on official channels, but somebody graciously saved the PDFs before they were taken down. They’re a rare but fascinating look into how these firms think about competition and acquisitions.

[**Building Products at Stripe**](https://newsletter.bringthedonuts.com/p/building-products-at-stripe)**:** I’ve long been fascinated by Stripe. From the moment I visited their headquarters a couple of years ago, it was immediately clear that it was a generationally special company. [This interview](https://newsletter.bringthedonuts.com/p/building-products-at-stripe) is a good window into their culture. First, they balance a sense of urgency with a long-term vision towards the future. Second, their writing-heavy culture enables rigorous thinking and extreme attention to detail.

[**WhisperSync**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000827761)**:** The entire book industry is limited by Amazon’s monopoly over book sales and electronic reading devices, but WhisperSync is a rare bright spot. For certain books, you can read and listen to a book at the same time if you purchase both the Kindle version and the audiobook. Doing so is the best way to highlight and take notes of audiobooks too.

[**The Deployment Age**](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/10/the-deployment-age.html)**:** Jerry Neumann wrote an excellent introduction to Carlota Perez’ framework of _The Deployment Age,_ from her book [_Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital_](https://amzn.to/2NemtJk)_._ The book comes highly recommended by people like Alex Danco, Fred Wilson, and Marc Andreessen. Based on the theory, we’re moving into an age of “production capital,” which [Neumann explains well](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/10/the-deployment-age.html).

**Entrepreneurship Hacks:** I found two great resources while hosting my Annual Review: [_Bench Bookkeeping_](https://bench.co/) and [_You Need A Budget_](https://app.youneedabudget.com/1f8314f3-b3e3-4fea-9d9b-55dca6661cfb/budget). The book-keeping service is geared towards small businesses and sole proprietors. The second is for anybody. _YNAB_ has a book, a podcast, and a highly recommended software product. Oh, and here are my friend Tiago’s notes from the [book](https://www.evernote.com/l/AMyBwvqZ1plDBY7cVP1WcnLmXFjHF3ngA2I).

[**Sequoia’s YouTube Thesis**](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/ae06bb4227110efa2a369753b/files/4024fb58-74ce-4616-90eb-99621b9067f6/Roelof_Botha_Sequoia_Youtube.pdf)**:** Sequoia Capital is widely regarded as the best venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. They were early investors in Apple, Google, Oracle, PayPal, Stripe, YouTube, Instagram, Yahoo! and WhatsApp. This memo from 2005 shows how they think about an investment. If you’re still curious and want to learn about the firm, I recommend this [podcast about Sequioa’s history](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/sequoia-capital-part-1).

[**Power to the People**](https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/)**:** Rich Barton is a rare breed. He’s built three billion-dollar consumer technology companies — Expedia, Zillow, and Glassdoor. This post tells the story of Barton’s strategy for building all three companies, which look different at first glance but are the same under the hood. If you’re interested in Internet business models, this essay is for you.

[**A History of Stripe**](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/stripe-teardown/): My friend Conor Witt (my co-writer for [_Naked Brands: The Future of Finance_](https://perell.com/blog/the-future-of-finance)) joined CB Insights, and kicked things off with a mega deep dive into Stripe’s relationship to the global payments system and their plans for the future.

[**Rethinking Economics**](https://amzn.to/2wZA8il)**:** I’m torn about the value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a metric. On one hand, it’s highly correlated with happiness indices, and people like [Tyler Cowen](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2019/01/09/tyler-cowen/case-longer-term) have gracefully argued that we should pursue a strategy of maximizing sustainable GDP, with a low discount rate on the future. With that said, the headstrong pursuit of GDP has perverse side effects for physical and emotional health. In the past 100 years, in America, we’ve seen the [decline of community](https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling), the [death of the nuclear family](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/), and a country that is increasingly obese and diabetic.

[**Great Assistant**](https://greatassistant.com/)**:** I hired my first personal assistant using this company. It’s pricey, but worth it in my opinion. For $4,000, they help you with all the logistics of hiring and training an assistant. If you choose to work with Great Assistant, tell them I sent you. On another note, If you ever need to delegate a project, [I recommend their 360 Delegation process](https://www.profitfactory.com/360delegation/), [which I summarized here](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1245536487476617218?s=20).

[**Crisis in Higher Education**](https://amzn.to/2zZ9yac): An obscure book about the future of higher education, focused on how small liberal arts schools can save themselves. The short answer: increase enrollment. It’s written by Jeff Docking, the President of [Adrian College.](http://adrian.edu/) I had breakfast with him and he’s exceptionally sharp. In 2005, the school had 840 enrolled students and had a tuition income of $8.54 million. By fall of 2011, enrollment had soared to 1,688, and tuition income had increased to $20.45 million.

[**Basecamp’s Legal Policies**](https://github.com/basecamp/policies)**:** An open-source GitHub repository with Basecamp’s policies, legal contracts, and terms of service. If you run an online business, starting here instead of with a lawyer could save you thousands of dollars. They are free to use under the Creative Commons Attribution license, so you can copy them and put them to work.

[**The Ladders of Wealth Creation**](https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/)**:** This essay from Nathan Barry lays out the roadmap for transitioning from an employee to running your own business, similar to the one I walked before starting my business.

[**The Startup School Library**](https://www.startupschool.org/library)**:** If you’re interested in building startups, this page is for you. It’s a collection of the best things Y-Combinator has learned about growing companies, from recruiting, to marketing, to fundraising.

[**Manias and Mimesis**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469465)**:** An outstanding paper that applies Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory to Financial Bubbles. It looks at a series of case studies, from the 1840s railway mania to the ICO boom and collapse, and even to present-day mimesis-driven market distortions. If you want a shorter analysis of a similar theme, I [recommend this essay](https://medium.com/newco/innovative-exuberance-ad75ee39f4c5) on bubbles as innovation accelerators.

[**Saudi Aramco**](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-01/saudi-aramco-makes-a-lot-of-money)**:** An introduction to one of the world’s wealthiest oil companies, which earned $366 billion in revenue in 2018, with a net income of roughly $110 billion. Most people don’t know this, but it was a wholly US-owned company until 1974 when Saudi Arabia got a 25% stake in the company (today, The Kingdom owns the entire company). This line says it all: “[Saudi Aramco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco) is—more even than Apple or Alphabet or Facebook Inc. or all the traditional champions—the greatest machine for the generation of money that the world has ever seen.”

[**Working in Public**](https://amzn.to/30C4CD1)**:** I read this new book about the economics of open-source software and online creators, in part because I interviewed the author, [Nadia Eghbal.](https://perell.com/podcast/nadia-eghbal-open-source-software) She worked at GitHub for roughly five years, where she interviewed hundreds of open-source developers. For a lighter introduction to her writing, I recommend [_Being Basic as a Virtue_](https://nadiaeghbal.com/basic)and [_The Tyranny of Ideas._](https://nadiaeghbal.com/ideas)

[**CleanShot**](https://getcleanshot.com/): This app solves a simple, but important problem: taking screenshots on a Mac. If that’s something you do a lot, check out CleanShot. It solves a simple problem very, very well.

[**CommandE**](https://getcommande.com/)**:** A cloud search tool for your computer so you can open any document, from Google Docs, to Dropbox, to Evernote, to Slack, to Asana, with a single search.

[**Bar Talk and Innovation**](https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3489466)**:** This paper measures the importance of informal social interaction for innovation. It does so by measuring the decline in innovation when wet counties turned dry during the Prohibition and banned alcohol consumption. It turns out, the negative effects of banning alcohol on innovation lasted only three years, after which groups found new ways to socialize and generate new ideas.

[**An Introduction to Thomas Sowell**](https://www.city-journal.org/thomas-sowell-race-poverty-culture)**:** An excellent introduction of Sowell’s work by Coleman Hughes. If you don’t know Sowell, he’s a Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. This essay tells the story of his life, from growing up without electricity or hot water in North Carolina, to moving to Harlem in 1939, to receiving his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago.

[**Loom**](https://www.loom.com/)**:** This is one of my favorite software tools. I use it for screen and video recordings whenever I need to explain something to a coworker. Suppose I have feedback for my assistant. Instead of writing up my thoughts, I record a video to show my thinking, which saves time and improves our communication because I can point to specific things on my screen.

**Palantir:** One of the most interesting companies in America. Palantir specializes in giant data analysis projects, mostly for governments and multinational companies. For balanced introductions to the company, I recommend [this explainer from Kevin Simler](https://www.quora.com/What-specifically-does-Palantir-do) about the product and [this one from Byrne Hobart](https://diff.substack.com/p/palantir-on-business-cults-and-politics) about the business model.

[**Starbucks’ Monetary Superpower**](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2019/08/starbucks-monetary-superpower.html)**:** I use the Starbucks app all the time because it’s one of the best payment apps in the world. This article explains how investing in it has turned the company into a quasi-bank. They have ~$1.6 billion in stored value card liabilities outstanding (6% of the company’s liabilities), which come from physical gift cards and the total digital value of balances in the Starbucks mobile app. All that money doubles as free debt that customers loan to the company.

[**What is Snapchat?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGXIQAHLnA)**:** An old video from Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, where he explains how images are changing conversation. “Snapchat has to do with how the photographs have changed. Today, pictures are being used for talking. That’s why people are taking and sending so many pictures on Snapchat every day.”

[**Hiring for the British Parliament**](https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/)**:** Here’s a job description from Dominic Cummings, the brilliant architect behind Britain’s _Vote Leave_ campaign. He’s bringing a fresh approach to politics by changing how political decisions are made and welcoming the dissent required to make radical changes to government. Cummings isn’t looking for the kinds of well-spoken and well-networked people you usually find in government. No. He’s looking for weirdos, scientists, and mathematicians. My friend called this post “the most promising thing I’ve seen out of Western government in a decade.” And he might be right. If you’re looking for an introduction to Dominic Cummings, I [recommend this 30-minute talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDbRxH9Kiy4).

[**Burger King’s Advertising Genius**](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1308398851192164354?s=20)**:** Marketing at its finest. I won’t give away the 90-second video, but Burger King used a clever marketing trick to attract millions of dollars in free attention and associate the brand with the world’s best soccer players.

**The Death of Sears:** A story about the fall of Sears, formerly one of America’s top retail brands. The company decided to implement an internal market where departments, stores, trucks, and suppliers competed against each other for cash and attention. But the market-based strategy was a total failure. My favorite anecdote was how Sears’ famous appliance brand, Kenmore, was divided between the appliance division and the branding one. Since non-Sears branded appliances were more profitable to the appliances division, they began to offer better placement to Kenmore’s rivals, which undermined overall profitability. Yikes. Thanks to the excellent [Sid Jha](https://twitter.com/sidharthajha) for the recommendation.

[**What is Amazon?:**](https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/)This is everything an essay should be and more. The author, Zack Kanter, is the founder of Stedi and understands how Amazon works better than anybody I’ve ever met. This essay is a long-form explanation of his analysis. My favorite part is his thesis that Amazon is a perpetual motion machine that innovates by discovering what works and amplifying the highest leverage experiments — evolution in real life.

[**Alex Karp Interview**](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/press-releases/mathias-dopfner-interviews-alex-karp-in-the-axel-springer-inside-pod-no-one-wants-to-live-in-a-world-where-they-have-no-private-sphere)**:** A two-part conversation with the CEO of Palantir, who is a fascinating guy. He runs a controversial company, and he addresses many of the critiques in [this interview](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/press-releases/mathias-dopfner-interviews-alex-karp-in-the-axel-springer-inside-pod-no-one-wants-to-live-in-a-world-where-they-have-no-private-sphere) with admirable levels of intellectual rigor. Just as interesting, he has a PhD in what amounts to progressive philosophy from the Frankfurt School in Germany. For more about Karp’s background, here’s an [excellent long-form essay about his academic career](https://www.boundary2.org/2020/07/moira-weigel-palantir-goes-to-the-frankfurt-school/).

**Long Haul by Simple Flying:** I’m an aviation geek, so I can’t believe I just found this YouTube channel, which eloquently describes trends in commercial aviation. In particular, I enjoyed this [history of the Boeing 737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3_SoIkBras) ([which I wrote about here](https://perell.com/blog/boeing-737-max)) and this one about the [rise & fall of the Airbus A340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cabTEFVOo88&t=474s).

[**Frequent Flyer Programs**](https://marker.medium.com/why-the-survival-of-the-airlines-depends-on-frequent-flyer-programs-2509bd3f25d0)**:** Speaking of airplanes, here’s a wild article from Byrne Hobart. Basically, airlines look like they make money from flights, but they actually make money from loyalty programs. Without its loyalty program, Delta would be worth -$7 billion. With it, it’s a $19 billion company. This quote stuck out: “The mechanics of a loyalty program are simple: Flyers earn rewards, generally by flying or using branded credit cards. They redeem those rewards for flights.” [You can read the full article here](https://marker.medium.com/why-the-survival-of-the-airlines-depends-on-frequent-flyer-programs-2509bd3f25d0).

[**Nick Yoder’s Prediction Algorithm**](https://nickyoder.com/wall-street-university-betting-markets/)**:** There’s a narrative out there that the polling data for the US election 2020 was terribly wrong. Here’s a data point against it: my friend used it to place hundreds of bets on the presidential election and walked out on top by a wide margin. If you’d like to learn about his methods, you’ll enjoy this multi-part series, which will also teach you about statistical modeling, trading, and portfolio management.

**20th Century Technology Theorists:** The gift that keeps on giving. Marshall McLuhan’s [_Understanding Media_](https://amzn.to/332O87S) is probably the most influential book I’ve read to date. Looking through the footnotes has led me to other philosophers of technologies Lewis Mumford, who wrote [_Technics and Civilization_](https://amzn.to/2UM3JnK) and Water Ong’s _Orality and Literacy_ ([here’s my book review](https://perell.com/blog/orality-and-literacy))_._ Their work gives you a framework to evaluate all kinds of new technologies, and reveals how the Internet is changing society.

****[**How to Take Smart Notes**](https://amzn.to/3tEgGQ0)**:** You know me: I love things that demystify the creative process. If you want to improve your writing, build a note-taking system. This is the best book I’ve seen about how to do that.” The author explains the creative strategies of a prolific sociologist named Niklas Luhmann. For a synopsis, I recommend [Tiago Forte’s written summary](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/) and [his interview with the author](https://youtu.be/kXnR7qX3BDc). In typical Tiago fashion, he nailed the pitch for reading this book: “Instead of squeezing as many pages as possible out of one idea, How To Take Smart Notes squeezes as many ideas as possible onto every page.”

****[**J. Cole**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlpN3S16ZAs&feature=youtu.be)**:** I took a Hip-Hop appreciation class during my freshman year of high school. I still remember one of the seniors doing a non-stop freestyle for upwards of 90 minutes. It was amazing. How did he come up with ideas so fast? [This video of J. Cole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlpN3S16ZAs&feature=youtu.be) gave me the same sensation. He exudes a special magic in the room — the kind you only find when you combine natural talent and cultivated excellence.

****[**Krista Tippett**](https://onbeing.org/series/podcast/)**:** Some people make the world a better place just by being exactly who they are. Krista Tippett is one such person. Her podcast, _On Being,_ is like a touchstone to me. It pairs the presence of meditation with the awakening of scripture. My all-time favorite interview is [the one with John O’Donahue](https://onbeing.org/programs/john-odonohue-the-inner-landscape-of-beauty-aug2017/). It inspired my essay: [_The Fruits of Friendship_](https://perell.com/essay/fruits-of-friendship/)_._

****[**Arnold Schwarzenegger**](https://amzn.to/3jDrvQw)**:** Well, this was fun! I’ve regained the excitement I used to have around weightlifting after I found a kick-ass gym in Oaxaca. People drip with sweat as they move through the gym, and the walls are covered with photos of professional bodybuilders. It’s awesome, partially because gyms in America are afraid to be so intense. [After seeing this snippet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1403898752054837249?s=20), I picked up Arnold’s book about bodybuilding. It begins with his story of winning five Mr. Universe and seven Mr. Olympia and Mr. World titles. In the second half of the book, he shares practical lessons for diet and a weightlifting routine. [I devoured the entire book](https://amzn.to/3jDrvQw).

**How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart:** Sometimes, great performers have such a natural talent that they’re unable to describe what makes them so great. This essay by David Foster Wallace explores that phenomenon through the lens of tennis. Though it focuses on sports, it’s not an essay about sports at all. I recommend [listening to the essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7BYK0hZibk) because Wallace is somehow so good at reading his own writing. Or, [here’s the PDF](https://sites.psu.edu/kingsel/files/2016/08/DFW-How-Tracy-Austin-Broke-My-Heart-1994-1lctx91.pdf) if you prefer to read it.

[**Pixar’s Guide to Storytelling**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1402416871408914440?s=20)**:** Short, simple, and fun. A few years ago, a Pixar employee wrote down what she’s learned about effective storytelling. I have two favorites. First, “You won’t see what the story is actually about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.” And second, “Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.“ If you want to fall down the Pixar rabbit hole, I recommend [_Creativity Inc._](https://amzn.to/3zuxoot)by the co-founder of Pixar.

****[**Kobe Bryant’s Favorite Scene from Whiplash**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWlktW0kj4)**:** Last week, I published a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/YfgprE5lcZ8) about Kobe Bryant’s career. His favorite movie, _Whiplash,_ is a window into his personality. It’s is about a drummer who is obsessed with greatness — often at the cost of friends and family. This scene where he breaks up with his girlfriend sticks out, especially the line where he says, “I don’t want to be great. I want to be one of the greats.”

****[**How Art Arrived at Jackson Pollock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1irNBh2qg8)**:** I’m obsessed with Nerdwriter’s channel. Most of his videos are about painting, movies, and poetry. His videos move at a slower pace than what you’ll otherwise find on YouTube, but that’s because his ideas are so deep that you need time to process them. If you’re in the rabbit hole mood, I [recommend his “Understanding Art” series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJAXu5OD-c&list=PLwg4AG1KkgLwP5FuUIiVEy-ILMD23AN1v).

**Neil Gaiman:** I spent the week listening to interviews from one of the most successful fiction writers of our time, who’s written comics like _The Sandman_ and novels like _Stardust_ and _American Gods._ To begin, I [recommend this interview](https://tim.blog/2019/03/28/neil-gaiman/) and [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPN7vDu9Rsk). Next up for me is [his Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg0_FinB6EE).

****[**The Early Days of MKBHD**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcugVUydSBY)**:** MKBHD is one of the most popular technology-focused YouTubers in the world. As I write this, he has 13.6 million subscribers and his videos have been watched 2.4 billion times. But when he recorded his 100th video, he only had 74 subscribers.

[**The Inner Game of Tennis**](https://amzn.to/3ef7qMa)**:** File this in the category of books that seem like they have to do with one thing but actually have to do with something else. On the surface, this book seems like it’s about tennis. But it’s actually about the relationship between body and mind, as they relate to performance. The author Tim Gallwey observed that most tennis players are plagued by too much judgment and technical instruction. Instead, he suggests that people learn through intuitive awareness and trust the ancient wisdom of their motor skills. [This YouTube video provides a good overview](https://youtu.be/HzR8x5MgvDw). Now, I’m reading another one of his books: [The Inner Game of Golf](https://amzn.to/2QyYUz3).

****[**Behind the Curtain**](https://youtube.com/c/BehindtheCurtain)**:** A series of video essays about the most successful screenwriters in Hollywood. The videos are curated interviews with big shots like [Quentin Tarantino](https://youtu.be/08t5lLDzIN8), writers of popular shows like [Rick and Morty](https://youtu.be/AktlCvZzkzk), and tactical ideas like “[How Pro Screenwriters Beat Writer’s Block](https://youtu.be/DplTEL4IoxA).” Instead of inserting their editorial voice, the editors scavenge the Internet for clips and let their subjects speak for themselves.

****[**Parasite**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film))**:** I finally watched Parasite. It was as good as everybody said it would be. Beyond the movie, I enjoyed [this 15-minute string of interviews with Bong Joon Ho](https://youtu.be/Rv_DzVn6CcM) about how he wrote the movie, and [this YouTube video from Nerdwriter](https://youtu.be/ma1rD2OP85c) about the movie was filmed.

****[**The Note that Defines Pop Music**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR32h5jhPtU)**:** YouTube is the best thing that’s ever happened to music education. It’s instant, fun, and visual in a way it’s never been before. [This video is a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR32h5jhPtU). One strategy in particular has taken over the pop world. Listen to enough pop music and you’ll start hearing the same note over and over again. It’s called “The Supertonic,” otherwise known as the second note in the scale. While we’re at it, I also recommend [this sample deconstruction](https://twitter.com/NehhLmao/status/1363925150958317568) from Daft Punk’s “One More Time.”

[**The Most Unruly**](https://youtube.com/c/NoisyImagesOfficial)**:** I appreciate how much Internet culture focuses as much on the behind-the-scenes of a craft as the craft itself. This YouTube channel, which focuses on Hip-Hop, is a stand-out example. In addition to mini-biographies of rappers like [Jay-Z](https://youtu.be/qu9e7YhYrac) and [Eminem](https://youtu.be/ufg64THzrfE), you’ll find making-of videos for [The Life of Pablo](https://youtu.be/EELBDtM3FGs) and [808s and Heartbreak](https://youtu.be/xSmgnf6PHmE) (my favorite Kanye album).

****[**A Steve Jobs Tribute**](https://youtu.be/n1HYdsbgYMA)**:** This one moved me to tears. Casey Neistat made this video after the iPhone’s original release in 2007 but didn’t release it until Jobs’ death. It’s filmed in the first person vlog-style that Casey made so popular on YouTube almost a decade after the video was published. If you’re an Apple fanatic, this will pull on all your heartstrings.

****[**Tiger Woods and Collin Morikawa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zXrDVRj3eM&t=572s)**:** Here’s a self-indulgent recommendation. It’s a conversation between the greatest golfer of all time and the reigning PGA Champion about how they think about hitting golf shots. For golf lovers, this is the kind of conversation you’ve always hoped you could listen to. So rarely is Tiger this honest! If you’re not a golfer, this is a window into the magical complexity of the game.

[**A Writing Masterclass:**](https://amzn.to/2Oygcfa) George Saunders has spent the past twenty years teaching a Russian short story class at Syracuse University. He studied writers like Chekhov, Tolstoy, and Turgenev. The essays provide a technical explanation for why their stories have resonated for more than a century. But this book isn’t dry like most of its counterparts. It’s alive with philosophy and deep questions about human existence.

****[**Kendrick Lamar’s “Element” Music Video**](https://youtu.be/kqGKMaCAao4)**:** Tthis was a beautiful exploration about the music video Kendrick Lamar created for “Element.” To be honest, I’ve never really understood the popularity of music videos. They rarely add meaning to the music, and as an outsider looking in, they feel like the most corporate part of the music industry. And yet, they’re consistently the most popular videos on YouTube. But the “Element” music video is an exception, as the [Nerdwriter beautifully shows here](https://youtu.be/kqGKMaCAao4).

****[**Golf’s Holy War**](https://amzn.to/39XIask)**:** I tore through this book. It told the story of the battle between art and science in the game of golf, which I’ve been thinking about for more than a decade. Some people like [Bryson DeChambeau](https://perell.com/essay/practice-analytically-perform-intuitively/) are embracing cutting-edge tools to measure the physics of ball flight and the biomechanics of the golf swing. But others think all that new technology is destroying the game. This book is about that “holy war.”

[**Destruction and Creation**](https://www.goalsys.com/books/documents/DESTRUCTION_AND_CREATION.pdf)**:** John Boyd was a US military strategist during the middle part of the 20th century. He’s known for the concept of the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop), but I like this paper even more. Though he was writing about military battles, his ideas about creating an accurate model of the world apply to just about anything. He says that creativity is less about simple creation but rather a constant oscillation between destructive deduction and creative synthesis. My friend Taylor Pearson [wrote the best summary I’ve seen of the paper](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-truth-about-how-creativity-really-works-46623efb6775?%20), and here’s how he summarized it: “Destruction is related to deduction, taking the big parts and breaking them down into constituent pieces. Creation is related to induction, synthesis, and integration. It’s taking the little bits and re-building them into a coherent whole.” Or, as I [wrote](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1369690289762414592?s=20), divergence and convergence.

**John Cleese on Creativity:** John Cleese was the inspiration for my [Beer Mode vs. Coffee Mode article](https://perell.com/note/open-mode-and-closed-mode/). He stresses the importance of free time in the creative process: “If you get into the right mood, then your mode of thinking will become much more creative. But if you’re racing around all day, ticking things off a list, looking at your watch, making phone calls, and generally just keeping all the balls in the air, you are not going to have any creative ideas.” For more, [I recommend this short video](https://youtu.be/gr2evrYB3wA) and his [short book about creativity](https://amzn.to/3coDFIY).

****[**Lessons from Mr. Beast**](https://youtu.be/lQCZ_fXfxqs): With 52 million YouTube subscribers, Mr. Beast has become a cultural force. This 30-minute conversation is an excellent introduction to his storytelling capabilities, and in particular, how he creates tension in his videos. The lessons they present are applicable to every creative medium too.

****[**The Courage to Be Disliked**](https://amzn.to/3fos7HH)**:** What if trauma doesn’t exist? What if all our focus on trauma traps us in the past instead of helping us look towards the future? That’s the thesis of this book by Ichiro Kishimi. It’s based on the ideas of [Alfred Adler](http://www.centroadleriano.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/EMAlfredAdler-TraumaTheory.pdf), an oft-forgotten psychologist who was a contemporary of Jung and Freud. Once again, I’m still in the exploratory phase here. But given the rise of depression and suicide rates in the West, something seems off about the psychological consensus. In Kishimi‘s words: “[Adler] is not saying that the experience of a horrible calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong. But the important thing is that nothing is actually determined by those influences. We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences. Your life is not something that someone gives you, but something you choose yourself, and you are the one who decides how you live.” For a contrasting perspective about the harmful effects of trauma, [I recommend this summary](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-body-keeps-the-score-summary/) about a book called _The Body Keeps the Score._

****[**Venkatesh Rao’s Quora Answers**](https://www.quora.com/profile/Venkatesh-Rao)**:** Venkatesh is one of those writers who has influenced almost all of my friends’ thinking but is virtually unknown outside of my social circle. That’s partially because his recent writing has been so hard to parse. But his early writing on Quora is unbelievably clear, and his article on improving your writing is a must-read.

[**The But & Therefore Rule**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1365438868284203009?s=20)**:** The creators of South Park share their favorite storytelling advice. Drive your story with words like “but” and “therefore” instead of “and then.”

****[**One More Time**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QwOpRh-IfI)**:** Daft Punk, the legendary pop music duo, have split. Their hit song is called “One More Time” and this 51-second video breaks down how a 1979 song called “More Spell on You” by Eddie Johns builds a foundation for its memorable beat. Don’t just watch this video for the entertainment. Watch it because it’s a masterclass in the kind of visual education that no book could ever provide.

****[**The Science of Storytelling**](https://amzn.to/3qTZHYR)**:** Storytelling is like an operating system for humanity. Some scientists have said that the brain is processing 11 million bits of information at any moment, even though we aren’t consciously aware of more than 40. Even though the actual numbers sound like pseudoscience to me, the general point is profound: our brains can’t make sense of all the information in the world, so we simplify it with narratives. This empirical look at how we do that will make you a better storyteller and a more effective communicator.

[**Ken Burns**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRb-_6MGl-c&ab_channel=Pew)**:** A friend texted me and said: “I think Ken Burns is the greatest storyteller in American history.” I can’t believe it, but I’ve never seen a full documentary of his. But once my friend sparked my curiosity, I listened to [this outstanding interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRb-_6MGl-c&ab_channel=Pew). The most surprising figure was that his 11.5 hour Civil War documentary was [culled](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1359276142256156674?s=20) from 22.73 miles of film.

****[**Manufacturing Intellect**](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vaipan)**:** This is the best place I’ve found to discover old interviews. While the rest of the Internet is focused on the here and now, it offers a chance to disconnect from the never-ending now and explore the wisdom of brilliant but oft-forgotten figures like [Joan Didion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diqZhz64l9w&t=65s) and [Susan Sontag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOCXuuFv9S8).

****[**Rolf Degen**](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=(from%3ADegenRolf)%20min_faves%3A800&src=typed_query)**:** The link is a collection of the most popular tweets from one of the best researchers I know. Scroll the feed and you’ll find academic studies about the psychology of trauma, gender relationships, and the [non-existent relationship between intelligence and susceptibility to foolish beliefs](https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/article/view/1696). By the way, [advanced searches](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) are one of the best ways to use Twitter. Picking an account and ranking their tweets by likes will help you find hidden gems.

****[**How a Chess Master Concentrates**](https://aeon.co/essays/playing-chess-is-an-essential-life-lesson-in-concentration)**:** On the “Practice Analytically, Perform Intuitively” front, I enjoyed this article from a chess master with a Life Title from the World Chess Federation. This quote is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read about mastery: “My search to do the right thing feels fundamentally aesthetic in nature… Good moves have the qualities of truth and beauty. They are discoveries of how things are, and should be.” That’s right. Beauty and excellence become synonymous at the highest levels of performance.

**Ava’s Writing:** I don’t know her last name, but Ava is one of my favorite up-and-coming Internet writers. Reading her work makes you feel like you’ve been invited into her social circle, but it stands out because she’s so absurdly observant and candid about her thoughts. At times, it even achieves what David Foster Wallace wanted for his own writing, when he said: “Most of the modern writing I like the best is both sophisticated and colloquial—that is, high-level and complicated but at the same time intimate, sort of like a smart person is sitting right there talking to you—and I think I do little more than try to achieve this same high-low blend.” Sometimes, she writes about [shame](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-shame). Sometimes, she writes about [the creative process](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-redoing-things). This week, she wrote about how [psychedelics](https://ava.substack.com/p/psychedelics-a-personal-take) influenced her mental state.

**Richard Wagner:** I’ve always been familiar with Richard Wagner’s music, but only recently did I begin to understand its tense history. At once, Wagner’s work set the stage for the kinds of dramatic movie scores you see in movies like Interstellar. His music wasn’t just sound. It was theater. But at the same time, his work has always been associated with antisemitism, in part because he was Hitler’s favorite composer. But that’s what makes him such a fascinating person to study. As the music critic Alex Ross said: “With Wagner, you never leave reality, and everything sublime and magnificent and moving in Wagner is inseparable from this corruption, this darkness, this evil. And I think that makes him a very human, unfortunately, exemplary human phenomenon, where the greatness and the darkness are all mixed together because that’s who we are as a species. And Wagner really exemplifies our species, in some ways, in terms of this mixing together of creative and destructive energies all at once, and you can never separate them — if that’s not too drastic.” Damn, that’s good. To learn about Wagner, I recommend [Alex Ross’ interview with Tyler Cowen](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alex-ross/) and [this one on _Open Source_](https://radioopensource.org/wagner-and-wagnerism/)_._

**[Why I Meditate](https://medium.com/@OshanJarow/why-i-meditate-3c82a1f17172):** Meditation pushes perception into the dark, pre-linguistic woods of consciousness. The stream of consciousness is not a ceaseless flow of words. Meditation is discipline in non-verbal perception. Where words fail, meditation carries the torch. 

**[Artist and the Machine](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/the-artist-and-the-machine/):** A history of the interplay between human tools and human thought. Beginning with 19th century realism, [Michael Nielsen](http://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen) explores the history of art and perception. [Nielsen](http://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen) demonstrates how, as we create new tools and probe deeper into nature, we discover new aesthetics and new forms of beauty.

**Theories of the World:** I have a new thesis. Many ultra-successful people have one big idea, and found success by doubling-down on it. There’s more complexity here, which you can read about in my essay [One Big Idea.](https://perell.com/blog/one-big-idea) But if you’re looking for some examples, I recommend this [series of lectures by George Soros](https://www.ft.com/video/eb6df6ec-1076-3cbc-a048-09f6374217fb) (Reflexivity) or my essay on [Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/blog/peter-thiel) (Mimetic Theory).

[**Podcast with Robert Cottrell:**](https://perell.com/podcast/robert-cottrell)[_The Browser_](https://thebrowser.com/)is the best link curation service I’ve found. I spoke to its founder for 90 minutes about what it takes to acquire good taste, how different people read, and the future of language translation. You can listen to the podcast on [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/north-star-podcast/id1170914572), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5WaTr94Kr7umvyuXYcobqA), or your go-to podcast app.

[**Shock of the New:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ne7Udaetg)I watch lots of YouTube videos, but usually they’re shorter than this series. For the past few weeks, I’ve been watching this excellent 8-part documentary on art history, hosted by Robert Hughes. The series traces the 100-year history of modern art, from the Impressionists in 1880 to the postmodernists in 1980. And if you like the documentary, I recommend the [book with the same title.](https://amzn.to/2SaOHX3)

[**The Lost Tools of Learning**](https://gbt.org/text/sayers.html)**:** A talk from poet Dorothy Sayers, given at Oxford University in 1947. In it, she argues that education began to lose its way in the Middle Ages. By bringing back the three lost tools of learning — grammar, logic, and rhetoric — we can foster self-directed learners instead of sleepwalking automatons.

**Amazon’s Great Courses:** You’ll find lectures from just about every topic under the sun. I purchased two lecture series: one about the [history of Christian theology](https://amzn.to/386wCPw) another on about the [Book of Genesis](https://amzn.to/2HX1NCu). In college, I remember listening to [this series on economic history](https://amzn.to/32yhwBp), which outlined the theories of people like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx.

[**Minerva**](https://amzn.to/33X25TZ): This is one of the best books I’ve ever read on education. My friend [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/), the former Director of Research at Kahn Academy, recommended it to me. Most books about education are rooted in opinion. But this one is grounded in empirical research. It tells the story of a new university called [_Minerva_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Schools_at_KGI)_,_ a San Francisco based school that re-thought education from the ground-up. Their pedagogy is based on a 1972 paper called [_Levels of processing: A framework for memory research_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002253717280001X)_._ If you’re interested in education, this book is for you.

[**Where Greatness Comes From**](https://youtu.be/MsWlktW0kj4%20)**:** I keep coming back to [this short movie clip from _Whiplash_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWlktW0kj4)_._ In it, a drummer breaks up with his girlfriend because he wants to focus on his craft. I won’t tell you any more because I don’t want to spoil it. Apparently, _Whiplash_ was one of Kobe Bryant’s favorite movies, and after you watch this short clip, you’ll understand why. Pair it with this [interview with Kobe Bryant](https://www.gq.com/story/kobe-bryant-nba-allstar) and a short article called [_Whiplash and Extreme Greatness_](https://tylerhogge.com/2015/10/07/whiplash-and-greatness/)_._

[**Jack Butcher**](https://shop.visualizevalue.com/)**:** If you aren’t familiar with [Visualize Value](https://twitter.com/visualizevalue), now is the time to change that. Jack is fast becoming one of my favorite online creators. He has the two things every online illustrator needs: stellar taste and a distinct style. He illustrates famous quotes to share timeless wisdom in ways that ring in your mind long after you read them.

**Childhood:** I’ve been studying the sociology of childhood. In particular, I recommend two books: [_The Disappearance of Childhood_](https://amzn.to/2Qawgl6) by Neil Postman and [_Deschooling Society_](https://amzn.to/2QcIPME)by Ivan Illich. Both of them wrote in the 70s, and offer perspectives that you won’t find in today’s mainstream commentary. Even if you aren’t interested in childhood, I recommend both authors’ backlog of books about the social effects of technology and industrialization.

**Note-Taking:** I went deep down the note-taking rabbit hole. I now have a firm grasp on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), each of which has radically different philosophies for how information should be stored, organized, and synthesized. If you want to learn Roam, I recommend [Nat Eliason’s introductory course](https://learn.nateliason.com/). Or, if you want to explore the philosophy of note-taking, I recommend [Andy Matuschak’s notes on the subject](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) (follow his hyperlinks).

[**David Cole’s Cannon**](http://davidcole.me/canon/)**:** More writers should do this. Heck, I should too. A former designer at Quora shares the works of scholarship underlying his worldview. Topics include purpose, process, product, user experience, and craft. If you like design, this page is for you.

**Stephanie Tolan:** You know somebody’s writing is going to be good when the articles are old, the design is ugly, and the articles are still popular. This site is Exhibit A. Stephanie writes about childhood education, mostly through the lens of gifted children. To begin, I recommend an article called [_Is it a Cheetah_](https://www.stephanietolan.com/is_it_a_cheetah.htm)_?_

**Yale Courses:** I realized I knew almost nothing about Karl Marx. He’s arguably the most important philosopher of the past 200 years, and I hadn’t engaged with his ideas. Concepts like alienation, exploitation, and the labor theory of value. Yale lectures are the first place I look whenever I want to study a new subject. I start with lectures and only start reading the books once I have foundational knowledge. As for Marx, I listened to the lectures from [SOCY 151: Foundations of Modern Social Theory](https://oyc.yale.edu/sociology/socy-151/lecture-9). [Here is the YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIlEkbU4rx0). No matter what subject you’re interested in, Yale lectures are a good place to begin.

[**JUMP**](https://medium.com/@micsolana/jump-23d06adb4cb7)**:** This is about the implications of a world where everybody can broadcast their ideas, and once shared, an idea can spread to the entire world in a matter of days. File this in the “I wish I wrote this essay” category, which is the highest praise I can give.

**Every Frame a Painting:** An exceptional YouTube channel with video essays that talk about how movies are made and how directors make films. I recommend this video about [how to compose visual movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doaQC-S8de8) or this one on [Jackie Chan’s action scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ).

[**Leisure: The Basis of Culture**](https://amzn.to/2uyDM1l): My friend recommended Andrew Taggert’s work to me, and after hearing about his [philosophy of “Total Work](https://aeon.co/ideas/if-work-dominated-your-every-moment-would-life-be-worth-living),” I went back to the source of it all: a [1948 manifesto](https://amzn.to/2PxSTiZ) about the problems with our contemporary work culture. In only 145 pages, it argues that we should learn from the Greeks, retreat from our culture of workaholism, and live a life of spiritual and intellectual nourishment. Here’s the book summary from [Brain Pickings.](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/10/leisure-the-basis-of-culture-josef-pieper/)

[**Contemporary Art**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTRal7R3G0f8E9rOf82XbZiBhL6IxzDCJ)**:** I’ve fast become a huge fan of John David Ebert. He is able to summarize shifts in art, media, and culture as well as anybody I know. I’ve been floating between his summaries of Spengler’s [_Decline of the West_](https://amzn.to/38roRnK)and the work of [Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkk16Pfmx-k). I found [this 59-part series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTRal7R3G0f8E9rOf82XbZiBhL6IxzDCJ) on contemporary art, based on his book [_Art After Metaphysics_](https://amzn.to/32XavKL)_._

[**Robert Sapolsky’s Stanford Lectures**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683): A series of 40 lectures from a legendary Stanford professor who wrote [_Behave_](https://amzn.to/2UaBMG9)_,_ one of the best biology books of the past decade.

[**The Danger of Silence**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiKtZgImdlY&feature=share)**:** I first found this 4-minute slam poetry video from Clint Smith when I was in college. I’m blown away by it every time I come back to it. In the video, Smith reminds us to read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, and tell your truth. To me, this is the pinnacle of public speaking.

[**Mary Oliver Interview with Krista Tippett**](https://onbeing.org/programs/mary-oliver-listening-to-the-world/)**:** Mary Oliver passed away, but her memory lives on through this rare interview with Krista Tippett. I recommend it as a starting point for the entire [On Being](https://onbeing.org/) podcast. She explores the spiritual life of writers, entrepreneurs, and religious figures with an emotional tenderness you won’t find on any other show. When you listen to one of Krista’s podcasts, you know you’re going to investigate the choir of the soul and the mystery of the universe. The environment she creates is as contemplative as a meditation retreat and as homey as the stuffed animal you used to hug as a kid.

**TV Tropes:** I love finding websites that remind me how little I know about the world. TV Tropes is a pop-culture wiki that catalogs common plot devices, archetypes, and tropes in all forms of media. The site is a little hard to navigate, but if you like storytelling, you’re going to have a blast exploring it. I suggest starting with this page on [Flanderization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) or this one about [why everything sounds sexier in French](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsSexierInFrench).

****[**David Whyte is an Everyday Poet**](https://www.dumbofeather.com/conversations/david-whyte-is-an-everyday-poet/)**:** If the first three links were for the mind, this one is for the heart. Whyte is particularly insightful on the tension between serving the wallet and serving the soul. But there are so many wonderful points in here about the art of conversation, the tradeoffs that come with commitment, and the virtues of craftsmanship. [Here’s the full interview](https://www.dumbofeather.com/conversations/david-whyte-is-an-everyday-poet/).

**Good Old Neon**: Of all the David Foster Wallace short stories, this is my favorite one. It’s a difficult window into the mind of a depressed person, narrated by a ghost from beyond the grave. Given that the author took his life a couple years after it was published, I suspect that it was a way to grapple with the warfare inside his own mind. [Here’s the audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f-Q9GHmJGc), and here’s a [free 41-page PDF](http://sdavidmiller.com/octo/files/no_google2/GoodOldNeon.pdf). The heaviness of it reminds me of _[The Death of Ivan Ilyich](https://amzn.to/38qeYtA)_ by Leo Tolstoy, which I equally recommend.

**Liberal Arts:** The West’s faith in the liberal arts is declining and I’m on a mission to find out why. To do so, I tore through Fareed Zakaria’s short book, [_In Defense of a Liberal Education_](https://amzn.to/3an1Zs7)_,_ which argues for the benefits of studying ideas from different disciplines and using college to expose students to many ways of thinking. In my study, I was happy to find a series of annual lectures at the University of Chicago called The Aims of Education. [Here’s the archive of speakers](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-life/aims-education). You can find most of the speeches with a Google search. In particular, I enjoyed [Robert Maynard Hutchins’ speech](http://www.ditext.com/hutchins/ae.html) from 1943.

**Liberal Arts:** I enjoyed Fareed Zakaria’s [_In Defense of a Liberal Education_](https://amzn.to/3j36MC5)_._ I also read [_Beyond the University_](https://amzn.to/2Ypz95o)by Michael Roth, which was a historical deep dive into how the liberal arts became what they are today. I recommend them both. If you’re looking for a personal narrative, read Zakaria’s book, and if you’re looking for history, read Roth’s.

[**Porter Robinson Interview**](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/longread/porter-robinson-ego-death-interview)**:** Woah, this is the best thing I’ve read about the creative process in a long, long time. I don’t know if it’s really good or if I’m just such a big Porter Robinson fan that anything he says will entertain me. Probably a little bit of both. If you do creative work, you will resonate with [what he’s saying](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/longread/porter-robinson-ego-death-interview).

**How Music Works**: While we’re on the topic of music, I recommend [_How Music Works_](https://www.amazon.com/How-Music-Works-David-Byrne/dp/0804188939/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+music+works&qid=1598631414&sr=8-1)by David Byrne. It’s written for a mass audience of people who like music enough to attend live concerts but haven’t studied it formally. Just like me. If you want to read a review of the book first, [consider this one from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/books/review/david-byrnes-how-music-works.html).

**An Introduction to Christopher Alexander:** I’ve now read two of Alexander’s books: [_A Timeless Way of Building_](https://amzn.to/2DNPJV2)and [_Notes on the Synthesis of Form_](https://amzn.to/3ik8wX6)_._ He’s excellent but notoriously hard to summarize (one of the marks of a great writer), but Ryan Singer tries to distill the key principles from his work in [this 90-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLsTZXT0FlM).

[**Swedish House Mafia**](https://twitter.com/danielgross/status/1301956935936282627?s=20)**:** I love watching creativity in action. This video is a behind-the-scenes of the making of One. Notice how the DJs are throwing out ideas, keeping what works, and throwing away the rest — all while having fun. [Here’s the extended video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jHy47m80bs) with Swedish House Mafia playing the song at Ultra. I like it because it shows how an idea can go from an experiment in a studio to the night of a lifetime for 80,000 people.

[**K-Pop**](https://dormin.org/2020/09/06/a-deep-dive-into-k-pop/)**:** These are the kinds of articles that make the Internet great. This deep-dive on K-Pop focused on why it’s so popular, how it represents an alternative to Western pop music, why the fandom is so intense, the arduous process of becoming a K-Pop star, and why it’s such a centralized and hierarchical industry.

**Beautiful Performances:** Living with five friends has introduced me to all kinds of videos I wouldn’t have found otherwise. Two things stand out: [Alicia Keys’ performance at the Grammy’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPbwJQ1XR4c) where she honors songs she wishes she’d written and this [Michael Jackson performance of Billie Jean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv2vixtkFu0) where the audience is moved to tears by his performance.

[**Bruno Cucinelli**](https://om.co/2015/04/27/brunello-cucinelli-2/)**:** This is an interview for the ages. The _New Yorker_ called Bruno Cucinelli the “king of cashmere.” He’s the founder of an eponymously named Italian fashion brand, which makes cashmere sweaters and earns more than $450 million per year in revenue. The interview is a trip through his philosophy of life and business, based on the pillars of dignity, beauty, and soul.

**David Whyte:** Whyte is an English poet, and I can’t stop listening to his interviews. He made me see how humiliation is a terrible feeling but a beautiful word. It comes from the Latin word humus, which means soil. So being humiliated is like returning to the ground of your being. Only by shedding those illusions of selfhood do you confront your own fragility. I recommend his interviews with [Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/podcasts/184-conversational-nature-reality/) and [Krista Tippett](https://onbeing.org/programs/david-whyte-the-conversational-nature-of-reality/). As you listen, your soul will fill up with the warmth of a fireplace on a cold winter night.

**James Turrell:** An American artist known for his work with light and space. Like [Yayoi Kusama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama), his work is made for our hyper-visual age, where art is photographed and shared on small screens. Almost all of Turell’s work is magnificent, but he’s at his best when he’s playing with rectangles. For an introduction to his art, I recommend [this short article](https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/james-turrell/), [his _New York Times_ profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/how-james-turrell-knocked-the-art-world-off-its-feet.html), or this [interview from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0g6JFYRKxQ).

[**Letters to a Young Poet**](https://amzn.to/3jK6pfJ)**:** A collection of letters from Rainer Maria Rilke, published in 1929. They double as a manual about living as an artist and doing creative work. Two creative virtues stand out: solitude and patience. The book is short enough to read in one sitting, but the writing is so beautiful that you’ll want to stop, put your book down, and reflect on the wisdom within it. Though it’s about poetry, anybody who does creative work will enjoy it.

[**99% Invisible**](https://99percentinvisible.org/)**:** A show about all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about, particularly in architecture and design. To date, this show is responsible for more of my Internet rabbit holes than just about any source I can think of. I recommend this two-part series about the [Bijlmeer](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/bijlmer-city-future-part-1/) or this one about the [carpet at the Portland airport](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pdx-carpet/). Every podcast comes with a full transcript, so you can choose how you want to enjoy the ideas.

[**Epic School in Oklahoma**](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/09/on-line-education-in-oklahoma-from-my-email-box.html)**:** There’s an online charter school in Oklahoma called Epic, which has 38,000 students and where teachers can earn more than $100,000 per year. The school was made possible by a law that gave online-only charter schools a separate regulatory structure from physical schools and didn’t have an enrollment cap. Epic is hated by most people in the traditional education industry. They’ve been the subject of multiple lawsuits, mostly around alleged fraud, but none of them have been resolved.

[**Gareth Hinds**](https://www.garethhinds.com/)**:** This author re-creates famous books with beautiful hand-drawn images. I particularly recommend them for people with kids. It might be fun to read the original book yourself, but share the picture-books with your kids so you can talk about the famous stories together. I immediately purchased his graphic novels about [_The Odyssey_](https://www.garethhinds.com/wp/the-odyssey/) and [_Gifts from the Gods_](https://garethhinds.com/wp/gifts-from-the-gods/)_,_ which is all about the wisdom of Greek mythology. If you purchase the books, get a paper version instead of a digital one.

[**How Malcolm X Learned to Read**](http://accounts.smccd.edu/bellr/readerlearningtoread.htm)**:** Here’s an inspiring story if there ever was one. [Malcolm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X) learned to read by reading the dictionary and learning each word, one-by-one. Crazy, right? He was in prison at the time, and as his vocabulary broadened, he binge-read books in the isolation of his prison cell. As he recounted: “When I had progressed to really serious reading, every night at about ten P.M. I would be outraged with the “lights out.” It always seemed to catch me right in the middle of something engrossing. Fortunately, right outside my door was a corridor light that cast a glow into my room. The glow was enough to read by, once my eyes adjusted to it. So when “lights out” came, I would sit on the floor where I could continue reading in that glow. [Here’s the full story.](http://accounts.smccd.edu/bellr/readerlearningtoread.htm)

# History, Science, & Math

****[**The World Chessboard**](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/world-chessboard)**:** Man, this series of articles is everything that history class should have been. The premise is that geography creates certain inevitable outcomes in the game of human achievement. This piece is about America’s advantages. Specifically, it has huge oceans on two sides and more miles of internal navigable waterways _than the rest of the world combined._ Yeah, you read that right.

****[**Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail**](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)**:** Speaking of [the 50 ideas that have influenced me the most](https://perell.com/essay/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life/), it might be time to add another one to the list: Reality has a surprising amount of detail. The idea comes from this [outstanding essay](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), and it applies to just about every discipline. People overestimate what they know and underestimate the complexity of the world. If you enjoy the essay, I also recommend [this derivative piece](https://taylorpearson.me/overconfidence-bias/?vgo_ee=JWFzqyY8ifV6vob2S73f%2FXwFoqDlMHNmyq65fGLdufk%3D).

**J.D. Unwin:** As a historian, [Unwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Unwin) studied 86 societies and civilizations to see if there was a relationship between sexual morality and human flourishing. He found a direct relationship between promiscuity and cultural decline. Cultures where people remained virgins until marriage were much more likely to be an “[advanced civilization](https://twitter.com/FoundationDads/status/1410242536678035456?s=20).” Combined with rationality, that prenuptial chastity sets the conditions for a successful society. I’m skeptical of big history claims like this, but after [reading this summary](https://www.kirkdurston.com/blog/unwin) of his [book](https://amzn.to/3htScEt), I’m looking forward to a deeper exploration of his work.

****[**A Guide to Demographics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9zH1dWeKE0)**:** I put on my scavenger hat whenever I write these emails. Most of all, I love finding old things on the Internet that have retained their relevance. Demographics are one of the most dependable ways to predict the future, so I enjoyed [this three-minute cross-cultural analysis from Peter Zeihan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9zH1dWeKE0). Globally, the world’s population is aging. One of America’s biggest advantages in the next decade is a young population.

[**Pepsi’s Giant Military**](https://nickyoder.com/5-minute-history-pepsi/)**:** As part of his budding 5-minute history series, Nick Yoder wrote about how Pepsi once had the 6th largest military in the world. Yeah, you read that right. The soda company had 20 warships, 17 submarines, and a destroyer.

****[**Peer-Reviewed Knowledge**](https://twitter.com/karakemark/status/1398643830161920006?s=10): A short video about the limits of peer-reviewed knowledge. Yes, we should be skeptical of anecdotal ideas and celebrate the scientific method. But that doesn’t mean we should discount the wisdom of intuition and observation. There are many claims that are obviously true even if we don’t have an academic paper to support them. As Paul Chek said so forcefully: “I don’t need a randomised controlled trial to know that a kick in the testicles is going to hurt.”

****[**We Should Drink Less Alcohol**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/28/mark-kleiman-on-why-we-need-to-solve-our-alcohol-problem-to-solve-our-crime-problem/)**:** It seems like every time I look into the science of alcohol, I realize how unhealthy it is. And it’s not just health. It’s all the stupid stuff you do when you drink because of the way alcohol lowers your time horizons. [Half the people in prison](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/28/smart-on-crime/) were drinking when they committed their crime (though the causality is hard to measure). Here, one researcher makes the case that any drug policy that doesn’t include “raise alcohol taxes” is missing the point. That said, I’m still not ready to quit 100%.

[**A History of Private Life**](https://amzn.to/3lOvRm8)**:** A five-volume set that reveals how people lived in the ancient world. I’ve only read [the first one](https://amzn.to/3hX3SkT), which covers the era from Pagan Rome to Byzantium. Author Paul Veyne shows how idleness was considered a virtue in the ancient world. [Leisure was considered the essence of a well-lived life](https://perell.com/essay/dont-kill-time/), which is the opposite of today’s cities where saying “I’m busy” has become such a status symbol. If you’re interested in the everyday lives of people in the ancient world, this series is for you.

****[**Are the Gospels Mythical?**](https://www.firstthings.com/article/1996/04/are-the-gospels-mythical)**:** Friends often say that the Gospels are mythical because they resemble some of history’s most popular myths. Here, Rene Girard attempts to dispel that myth. Basically, he claims that the Gospels are unique because the victim is innocent. Though this article isn’t that long, it’s extremely dense. If you want to dive into Girard’s work, start with [my long-form essay about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/) where I discuss his ideas in depth.

****[**What the Hell Happened in 1971?**](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)**:** Something eerie happened in the early 1970s, and this website has the data to back it up. For example, wage growth stagnated for the bottom 90% of workers, leading to rising inequality. City growth froze too. In 1970, Los Angeles was zoned for 10 million people. By 2010, the city was zoned for only 4.3 million people, and the rate of new housing developments has fallen since the 1970s. Adjusted for population growth, we have about [350% fewer housing starts](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1220223237629661184?s=20) than we did in 1971.

****[**The Mathematics of Beauty**](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/themathematicsofbeauty.html)**:** If you want to consistently find interesting ideas, find a corner of the world where there’s an explosion in the amount of data we have about it. Then, follow the writers who make sense of it all. One example is the OkCupid blog. To the best of my knowledge, many of the best posts have been removed from the Internet because they were so spicy. That said, you’ll find many of the ideas in a book called [_Dataclysm_](https://amzn.to/3qeZa2A)_._ But some of them were saved, such as [this one](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/themathematicsofbeauty.html) from Gwern. For an interesting rabbit hole, check out the recommendations on the right side of the page.

****[**Martin Luther Rewired Your Brain**](https://thisviewoflife.com/martin-luther-rewired-your-brain/)**:** Joseph Henrich is the kind of person who I stop everything for when he publishes a new article. That’s why [interviewing him](https://perell.com/podcast/joe-henrich-what-makes-society-smart/) a couple of months ago was so enjoyable. His most recent article is about how the printing press rewired our minds, with empirical data coming from the post-Protestant Revolution era.

****[**Shock of the New**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_of_the_New): A [book](https://amzn.to/3hAbOGB) and a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ne7Udaetg) from the famous art critic, Robert Hughes. It’s by far the best thing I’ve seen about the history of modern art, from the 1870s to the 1970s. It focuses on a variety of themes, from the failure of modern architecture, to the rise of pop culture, to the legacy of the world wars, to the transition from impressionism to cubism (which is my favorite part of art history). It’s a dazzling piece of scholarship and I can’t recommend it enough.

****[**The Tyranny of Numbers**](https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/p/the-tyranny-of-numbers)**:** We live in a society where the numbers have the final say. When revenue goes up, the business is healthy. When GDP goes up, so does the economy. But focusing too much on numbers can lead to adverse side effects. Not everything that counts can be counted. By obsessing over numerical improvements, we often ignore the aspects of life that can’t be measured and lose sight of what ultimately matters.

[**How All This Happened**](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-this-all-happened/) — A short economic history of America since World War II. Things were very uncertain, then they were very good, then pretty bad, then really good, then really bad, and now here we are. [Morgan Housel](https://perell.com/podcast/morgan-housel-writing-for-the-internet/) outlines a narrative that links all the events together. 

**Andrew Batson:** If you want to learn more about China, I recommend Andrew Batson’s blog. He writes for Gavekal as their Director of Chinese Research. Start with this post on the [battle for ideas in China](https://andrewbatson.com/2020/01/07/who-won-the-battle-of-ideas-in-china/).

[**Peace of Westphalia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia)**:** The Thirty Years’ War was one of the most deadly periods in European history, and led to the deaths of roughly 8 million people. The violence was settled with a series of peace treaties in 1648. Scholars have identified the treaties as the beginning of the modern international system, and in particular, the concept of sovereign states.

[**Bowling Alone**](http://www.directory-online.com/Rotary/Accounts/6970/Downloads/4381/Bowling%20Alone%20Article.pdf)**:** Robert Putnam’s book [_Bowling Alone_](https://amzn.to/36Honch)is one of the most influential pieces of American sociology ever written. In it, he talks about the decline of social life in America, including the fall in church membership, attendance at public meetings, and the number of Americans who participate in associations. This is an [excellent summary of the book](http://www.directory-online.com/Rotary/Accounts/6970/Downloads/4381/Bowling%20Alone%20Article.pdf).

**Singapore:** A [series of four outstanding Reddit posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ceajmw/book_review_from_third_world_to_first_by_lee_kuan/), which summarized Lee Kuan Yew’s book, _From Third World to First_**_._** The posts will take you a few hours to read, but you’ll leave with a deep understanding of how the country operates. If these ideas interest you, you’ll also enjoy my essay on the [history of Singapore](https://perell.com/blog/story-of-singapore).

[**How to Remove CO2 From the Sky**](https://www.orbuch.com/carbon-removal)**:** These are exactly the kinds of articles we need more of. Anything that touches climate change is politicized, so when I find an article from a trusted source, I have to share it. The author (friend of a friend, so I trust him) spoke with more than one hundred experts to write a beginner’s guide to Negative Emissions Technologies.

[**Space in High Definition**](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1242a/zoomable/)**:** An ultra-high quality photo of the stars and the sky. Open it on a computer browser, zoom in as much as you can, and open your heart to the vastness of the universe.

**Mushrooms and the Birth of Christianity**: Okay, this one is a mind-bender. It falls under the probably-not-true-but-super-interesting category. [John M. Allegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Allegro) was an archaeologist and who studied the Dead Sea Scrolls. His book, [_The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross_](https://amzn.to/2OSPlHO) was particularly controversial because it argues that Christianity began as a shamanistic cult. Then, when the Gospels were written down, the Evangelists confused the meaning of the scrolls, which means the entire Christian tradition is based on a misunderstanding of them. One scholar called it “possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic,” and Allegro was banished from the academy after it was published. Honestly, I have no idea if his claims have any legitimacy. I don’t know how to evaluate them, but [this article](http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm) does a thorough job arguing that we should look into Allegro’s theories again.

[**Open**](https://amzn.to/3a5RtV1)**:** This is an excellent biography of Andrei Agassi, the former #1 tennis player in the world. It’s an emotional journey through the sacrifices required to become a top-tier athlete. For example, even when he was the world’s top tennis player, Agassi didn’t enjoy tennis. And as it turns out, the book’s ghostwriter named J.R. Moehringer also penned [_Shoe Dog_](https://amzn.to/393uc50)_,_ the biography of Phil Knight, which tells the story of Nike.

[**How Airplanes Fly**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/)**:** The physics of flight has interested me ever since I was a kid. I took flying lessons during high school, in part because of a program for Bay Area teenagers called _Young Eagles,_ which allowed kids like myself to fly airplanes for free. Yes, it was as cool as it sounds. To this day, I still turn my head whenever a plane flies above me. [This article explains](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/) the science of aerodynamics as well as anything I’ve ever seen.

**Will Durant:** What a criminally under-rated author. Along with his wife Ariel, he wrote [an 11-volume, 13,974-page tome](https://amzn.to/2y2tdoR) on the history of human civilization. From what I hear, it’s as thorough as anything that exists. But what if you don’t have time to read thousands of pages? Well, I have good news for you. Towards the end of his life, Durant summarized his learnings in three short books: [_Lessons of History_](https://perell.com/blog/history)is for your mind, [_The Story of Philosophy_](https://amzn.to/2yIRMaw)is for your heart, and [_Fallen Leaves_](https://amzn.to/2xkPEFJ) is for your soul.

**3Blue1Brown:** Grant Sanderson (one of my [podcast guests](https://perell.com/podcast/grant-sanderson-math-for-the-masses)) makes excellent math-related videos on YouTube. You’ll find videos on topics like linear algebra, neural networks, calculus, the math of Bitcoin, and quantum mechanics. With every video, he turns abstract symbols into concrete visualizations. Then, he adds narrative to a mathematical concept. Start with this video on the virality of [Coronavirus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg) or [this series about calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM).

**Edge:** This website is a hidden treasure. On it, you’ll find all kinds of interviews with great writers and articles about forgotten scientific ideas. I don’t know how this website has managed to fly under the radar for so long, but it’s worthy of your attention. Start with [this essay on Composers as Gardners](https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners), [this one on the problems with String Theory](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25547), or this [interview with Rory Sutherland](https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-things-to-hang-on-your-mental-mug-tree).

[**Requiem for the American Dream**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZnuc-Fv_Tc): A [book](https://amzn.to/2ziZw3w) and a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZnuc-Fv_Tc) from Noam Chomsky, focused on 10 principles for the concentration of wealth and power. Chomsky tells the story of how society has transformed from the 1970s to now by focusing on ten themes: democracy, ideology, redesigning the economy, shifting the burden, attacking solidarity, running the regulators, engineering elections, keeping the rabble in line, manufacturing consent, and marginalizing the population. If you agree with everything he’s saying, you’re not thinking hard enough. But Chomsky’s bold perspectives will force you to take a stand. And if you want a summary, [here’s the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_the_American_Dream).

[**A Brief History of the Corporation**](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/): If you’ve never heard of _Ribbonfarm,_ it’s time to change that. It’s mostly written by Venkatesh Rao who is absolutely brilliant, even though he’s often more obscure than I’d like. This essay about the corporation is one of the best things he’s ever written. I also recommend essays like [_The Throughput of Learning_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/01/31/the-throughput-of-learning/)and [_A Big Little Idea Called Legibility_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/)_._

[**The Plague in Literature and Life**](https://www.theaquilareport.com/the-plague-in-literature-and-life/): This essay builds on [Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) and Dostoyevsky’s [_Crime and Punishment_](https://amzn.to/2A3pCYN)novel to show that the social anarchy after a plague is usually worse than the plague itself.

[**The Story of Oprah Winfrey**](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/oprah-harpo-studios)**:** Oprah might be the most successful media personality in American history. This two-hour podcast episode is the best explanation of her story I’ve seen, from the adversity she faced as a teenager to becoming one of the wealthiest women in the world.

[**Outbreak**](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/outbreak/): This is the best COVID-19 related visualization I’ve seen. It was created by Kevin Simler, one of my all-time favorite writers. It’s a “playable simulation,” meaning that you can change the variables to visualize how they impact the spread of a disease. If you like these visualizations, I also recommend this one from the [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)_._

[**Nicky Case**](https://ncase.me/): Building upon the theme of playable simulations, I recommend Nicky Case’s entire website. The [complex systems](https://ncase.me/attractors/) simulation is my favorite, but I also recommend this interactive comic on the science of memory, and this one about [game theory](https://ncase.me/trust/), which is inspired by a book called _The Evolution of Trust_, which I [summarized here](https://perell.com/blog/why-people-cooperate). If nothing else, these visualizations are a window into the future of online writing.

[**Labor Supply and the Attention Tax**](https://kortina.nyc/essays/kinky-labor-supply-and-the-attention-tax/)**:** A long-form essay about why labor force participation has declined for men between ages 20-34. The authors propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signaling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.

[**Ole Peters**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1vXAHGIpfc)**:** A fascinating talk by a researcher from the Santa Fe Institute. It’s about ergodicity, which is one of the most insightful ideas I’ve heard in the past few years. Peters builds upon Boltzmann’s 1870 probability theory and cutting edge mathematics to question economic doctrines. His conclusion is surprisingly accessible and impacts how we think about risk, market stability, and economic inequality.

[**Superforecasting**](https://dominiccummings.com/2016/11/24/a-review-of-tetlocks-superforecasting-2015/)**:** This [book](https://amzn.to/37IOSA2) (written by Philip Tetlock) is long, but everybody should be familiar with it. Luckily, Dominic Cummings wrote an [excellent primer](https://dominiccummings.com/2016/11/24/a-review-of-tetlocks-superforecasting-2015/).

[**Unlimited Information is Transforming Society**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/unlimited-information-is-transforming-society/)**:** This article is pure fun. It’s basically a short, “Big History” piece. It tells the story of how technologies like electricity, nuclear energy, and heavier than air flight evolved and shaped humanity. It follows the march of progress into today’s world of computers and the Internet.

[**Building in Singapore**](https://vimeo.com/458098734)**:** A gorgeous 5-minute video that shows how fast new buildings are rising in Singapore. Right now, the architecture of the future is centered there more than any other city in the world. While I’m certainly not a fan of everything Singapore does, Westerners should spend a lot more time studying them. A little envy for the quality of their infrastructure would be a good thing too.

[**History of the Idea of Progress**](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/idea-of-progress-a-bibliographical-essay-by-robert-nisbet)**:** There are two predominant ways to think about time: linearly and cyclically. Today, we tend to think about it linearly, which wasn’t always the case. The linear conception of time has its roots in the Christian tradition where the world starts in the Garden of Eden at the beginning of the Old Testament and moves towards a New Heaven and a New Earth at the end of the New Testament. I wrote extensively about this idea in [my essay about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/blog/peter-thiel). Most of the ideas were inspired by [this outstanding essay by Robert Nisbet](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/idea-of-progress-a-bibliographical-essay-by-robert-nisbet). You might also enjoy [this slide deck from Arthur Chandler.](http://www.arthurchandler.com/the-idea-of-progress)

**The Scholar’s Stage:** This is an outstanding collection of essays, all from a single writer named Tanner Greer. The site focuses on history, strategy, and geopolitics. To date, my favorite essays are [_Tradition is Smarter Than You Are_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html) and [_Taking Cross Cultural Psychology Seriously_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/12/on-taking-cross-cultural-psychology.html)_._ But Tanner is particularly a must-read if you’re interested in China. If so, I recommend [_The Chinese Strategic Tradition_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-chinese-strategic-tradition.html) and [_China’s Stalinist Heritage_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/01/reflections-on-chinas-stalinist.html)_._ If you’re looking for a rabbit hole to fall down, this is an excellent place to jump.

[**How Aristotle Created the Computer**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/)**:** This essay traces the history of logic from Aristotle to modern computing. It builds upon the early days of Euclidean geometry, when mathematics was considered a hopelessly abstract subject with no practical use. Later, it moves into Claude Shannon’s work on information theory, which runs the computer you’re using to read this sentence. Here’s a good summary: “Logic began as a way to understand the laws of thought. It then helped create machines that could reason according to the rules of deductive logic. Today, deductive and inductive logic are being combined to create machines that both reason and learn.”

[**A History of Private Life**](https://amzn.to/3lOvRm8)**:** A five-volume set that reveals how people lived in the ancient world. I’ve only read the first one, which covers the era from Pagan Rome to Byzantium. Right now, I’m particularly interested in the history of work and leisure. Author Paul Veyne shows how idleness was considered a virtue in the ancient world. Leisure was considered the essence of a well-lived life, which is the opposite of today’s cities where saying “I’m busy” has become such a status symbol.

[**Birds and Frogs in Physics**](https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2020/11/birds-and-frogs-in-physics.html)**:** I’ve always liked the Fox vs. Hedgehog distinction between people who know a little bit about many things and people who know a lot about one thing. This essay makes a similar argument that people are either birds or frogs. Birds see things from, well… a bird’s eye view where they have a vast landscape in front of them without a lot of detail. On the other hand, frogs like to get dirty and dive into the nitty-gritty details. But this essay goes beyond that and tells a brief history of physics. Einstein and Feynman were birds, while Fermi and Hubble were frogs.

**Richard Feynman:** A theoretical physicist known for his work in quantum electrodynamics and a Nobel Prize in 1965. A friend had a three-volume book with all his lectures. Walking by them regularly inspired me to watch his YouTube videos and read the transcripts ([freely transcribed on CalTech’s website](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)). Beyond physics, Feynman achieved the impossible: he became a brilliant adult but never lost the playfulness of a child. To appreciate his fun, [start with this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ww1IXRfTA&t=2063s) about jiggling atoms, rubber bands, and intellectual puzzles.

****[**Augusta National**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/24/inside-the-cultish-dreamworld-of-augusta-national)**:** I love the word _Valhalla._ In Norse mythology, it describes a majestic place where people live blissfully under the hand of God. Augusta National, the world’s top golf course and the host of the Masters Tournament, is the closest thing I’ve seen to that definition. It’s so immaculate that it almost feels mythical. This article describes all the ends (sometimes dark) that the club goes through to give the course a surreal glow.

****[**Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Approach to Bodybuilding**](https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1403898752054837249?s=20)**:** I grew up in California with Arnold as my governor, but I somehow never appreciated him. First, he became a world bodybuilding champion. Then, he said, “I’m going to become one of the most famous actors in the world.” Then, he became the governor of California. Insane. For a window into his work ethic and all the fun he had doing it, I got a good laugh out of [these two pages](https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1403898752054837249?s=20) from one of his [biographies](https://amzn.to/3jh8GSS).

****[**Comparing Weather**](https://weatherspark.com/)**:** I would’ve never expected to have this much fun playing with a weather tool, but here we are. You can see how the climate of any city changes throughout the year. Most maps will show you temperature, but everybody knows that’s only part of the story. This tool will also show you sunlight, humidity, cloud cover, and a tourism score which will tell you the best time to visit.

**Matthew McConaughey:** Let’s start with an airport bookstore recommendation. As you know, the purpose of Friday Finds is to escape the intellectual spotlight as much as possible. If it’s in the news, I cut it. But this week we have a glitch in the system. Mr. McConaughey’s memoir, [_Greenlights_](https://amzn.to/398Rp8X), is so good that it gets to hang at the top today. Unlike other celebrity books, he actually wrote it. The storytelling is top-notch, and if you’re looking to laugh so hard that tears fall from your eyes, pick up the audiobook.

[**Fellow Kettles**](https://fellowproducts.com/products/staggekg?variant=31212438224996)**:** Now that I’ve been moving apartments, I’m in the market for well-designed home appliances. Most of mine work “fine.” But there’s one that puts a smile on my face every time I use it: [the Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Pour-Over Kettle](https://fellowproducts.com/products/staggekg?variant=18635551080563). It lets you control the temperature of your drink, down to the degree. If you make pour-over coffee, it has a host of other features like a stopwatch and a PID controller to help you hold the perfect temperature over time.

[**Getaway**](https://getaway.house/)**:** A startup called Getaway has cabins around the country that offer easy trips away from major cities. They’re 1-2 bedrooms, and they’re all in nature. It’s basically a hyper-specific Airbnb, but geared towards short escapes to the woods. I haven’t tried it yet, but am going to book a cabin for the spring.

[**Obscure PDFs**](https://www.reddit.com/r/obscurePDFs/): This is a Reddit collection of PDFs you won’t find anywhere else. On the page, you’ll find in-depth looks into restaurant business models, the 100-year history of erotic art, the psychology of fascism, how the quantum search algorithm works, and the CIA’s simple sabotage field manual.

[**Barstool’s Pizza Reviews**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnLIPjYS__o)**:** You weren’t expecting this link, were you? Every day, [Barstool Sports](https://www.barstoolsports.com/) founder Dave Portnoy reviews a different pizza shop. Even if the brand looks casual, Barstool’s [_Pardon My Take_](https://podcastone.com/pardon-my-take) _is the_ biggest sports-related podcast in the world. In this pizza review, Dave is with a few celebrities in Midtown Manhattan. Halfway through, a girl walking next to him recognizes Dave (the Internet celebrity), without acknowledging the traditional Hollywood ones (Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jeremy Renner, Jake Johnson, and Hannibal Buress). Videos like this highlight the under-estimated inertia behind Internet culture.

[**Criterion Collection**](https://www.criterionchannel.com/browse)**:** My writing coach [Ellen Fishbein](http://ellenrhymes.com/) is a movie fanatic, and says this platform is the best place to find and watch movies. The service is dedicated to promoting exceptional classic and contemporary films. Each film is presented in the way the directors would have wanted them to be seen. I can’t believe I didn’t know about this.

[**Media Mail**](https://about.usps.com/notices/not121/not121_tech.htm): If you’re an American and you ever need to send educational materials, use Media Mail. It’s a government-subsidized service from the United States Postal Service designed for media like books, movies, CDs, articles, and magazines. Best of all, there’s no catch. Using media mail is as simple as shipping a regular package.

[**Google Books Ngram Viewer:**](https://books.google.com/ngrams) This tool tracks the frequency of any set of word strings found in sources printed between 1950 and 2019. With its online search engine, you can see how words and phrases have risen and fallen in popularity throughout history. At the very least, it’s a blast to play with. And at most, it’s a window into mass psychology over the centuries.
